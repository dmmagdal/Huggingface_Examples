The message said: 'Hey, I want to talk. Meet me in the alley behind the school during lunch?'That sounded sorta bad. Although to be fair, the words "I want to talk" are immediately anxiety-inducing in any circumstance, so I replied with a quick 'sure!' and put it back. I checked the clock. It was four hours until lunch. I sighed. This was going to be a long day.-:-:-:-Finally, after powering through incredibly long incredibly boring Chemistry, Math, History and AP Lit periods, lunch came around, but instead of going to the cafeteria and getting lunch as I usually do, I went outside and towards the music building. In my school, the music and auditorium buildings are right at the back of the campus, and behind that is a little alley where students go to make out or smoke weed or whatever, which also was the meetup point Bryce had told me to go to.I walked to the music building and then went around to the back into the little alley. I saw a couple making out and someone smoking weed, and after scooting past with a little 'excuse me', I finally saw Bryce. He was on the other end of the alley, leaning against the wall, looking around for me. His shirt was tight and you could see his muscles protrude against the sheer material. God he's so hot. But finally he saw me and waved me over."Good, you're here," he said nervously."Yeah, hi. Why did you want to talk?" I asked, slightly concerned."Um...okay. I don't really know how to say this."He looked at me. I nodded, urging him to keep going.He took a deep breath. "Isaac, I've been having a lot of fun with you lately. The, um, hookups," he said, lowering his voice on the last word, "have been really great. But I think that maybe I want to, um..." he trailed off."...yes?" I said encouragingly. This could go one of two ways: break up or date. I hoped for the latter."I think that I want to go on a real date with you. Look, I really like you. Honestly I just wanted to get my rocks off at first but, after yesterday, I've been feeling confused about my own feelings. Lately I've been thinking about guys a lot like that too, and I kind of want to explore that. So I want to get to know you better and maybe go on a date." he said quickly, blushing.I giggled. "You're cute when you're nervous.""Is that a yes?""Yes, Bryce. I would love to go on a date with you," I said, then whispered, "Especially after what we did yesterday. You were right, I almost couldn't sit down last night.""Dude!" he silent-screamed and looked around nervously, "We're in public!""Whatever. So, Friday night?""Uh, sure! Pick you up at eight?""Okay! Bye Bryce!"I walked away, not betraying my real feelings. I looked cool and confident, two words that would never describe me, but instead I was freaking out inside. A date! Finally! I thought this could never happen to me! I felt like a hundred confetti cannons were going off inside me! Or maybe that was the Starbucks I had this morning. Anyway, I was excited. It was Wednesday, which meant Friday was only two days away. I immediately began planning everything from what I was going to wear to what I was going to say. I couldn't wait!Turns out, those two days could not go by slower. The classes dragged on, hour after hour, feeling like years had passed, then glancing at the clock and realizing there was still half an hour left of class. I sat anxiously in my seat until Friday, and when the final bell rang announcing the weekend I got up so fast I practically teleported to my locker, put my stuff in my bag and ran home. I hadn't told my parents I had a date (who does that?), so instead I told them I was gonna go out with some friends. They agreed to let me go on the condition that I would be home by eleven o'clock.I got home and went straight to my room, trying to pick an appropriate outfit. To be fair, Bryce hadn't told me where he was going to take me, a movie, a restaurant, or anything else. I decided to go on the safe side. A slightly formal yet still fun button-up paired with some black jeans. Casual, but still semi-formal. I had no idea what to do with the time left, which was like three hours, so I just sat in my room for a while watching Youtube videos, anxiously glancing at the clock every now and then.Finally, eight o'clock rolled around, and he was right on time. Just as I'd realized what time it was I got a text from him saying he was outside. I raced to the window and there he was, standing outside his car across the street from my house. Thankfully he hadn't worn anything super formal either, just some slacks and a (delightfully tight) button-up. I ran excitedly down the stairs and to the front door, but just before I opened the door I calmed myself down, trying to look cool and collected, something I definitely was not in that moment. He saw me walk outside and quickly skipped over to the passenger side, opening the door for me to get in."Hi Bryce," I greeted him nervously as I sat down in his car."Hey Isaac," he said as he started the car, sounding even more nervous than I was."So, where are you taking me?" I asked, because I really had no idea."You'll see," he said with a tad of smugness in his voice, "it's a surprise."We drove off, heading through the suburbs and eventually getting to the city. Eventually, we slowed down and pulled into the parking lot of a familiar (and familial) restaurant."Olive Garden?" I asked, slightly incredulous."Yeah! Why? Do you wanna go somewhere else? It's fine if you do, I can-" he began."Shh, Olive Garden is great. I guess I just wasn't expecting it.""Oh, okay, great! Now, let's go eat."We went inside. Turns out he made a reservation for us! He got us a small booth near the back by a window. We ordered our food and waited for it to arrive. Meanwhile, we made some small conversation."So, what do you like to do for fun?" he asked me."Well, I love to read, and sometimes I like to write stories and stuff," I answered, slightly nervous."Really? That's so cool! I'm not really the creative type.""Well, what do you like to do for fun?""Well, I work out and play football, obviously. But sometimes I do like to draw.""Cool, I didn't know that about you!"The conversation went on like that for the rest of the date. Turns out we had a lot in common. We both liked art, we both loved horror movies, we both listened to the same kind of music (he surprisingly listened to a lot of Lady Gaga), and we both had a similar sense of humour. We laughed over jokes, discussed serious topics, recommended movies and generally had fun and got to know each other pretty well.After we finished our food, he paid (he insisted and would not even let me split the bill, much to my dismay), we walked back to his car and got in.I turned to him. "I had a really great time today.""Me too," he said, also turning to look at me, "I didn't know we had so much in common! I'm glad I asked you out."I leaned closer, "I'm glad you asked me out too." I could feel the heat coming off his face. We were at kissing distance now. He leaned closer and I did too. He put his hand on my cheek and kissed me softly. I returned his kiss, and soon it was starting to get a little hot and heavy in the car. Hands explored bodies, over jeans, under shirts (oh those glorious muscles). I put my hand on his thigh and slid it upwards, and there it was. I felt his bulge under his pants, still marveling at the size and girth of it and how I managed to take it inside me a few days before. But he put his hand on mine and pulled away. Immediately I got concerned."Am I going too fast? Sorry if it's too much. We don't have to do anything today if you don't want to," I said quickly."No, don't worry, you're fine," he said, "I just don't want to 'get it on' in a car in an Olive Garden parking lot.""Oh. Right," I said, remembering we were still in his car."Do you wanna go back to my place?""What about your parents?""Out of town until Sunday. Said they wanted to 'get away', whatever that means.""Then yes. Definitely yes.""Great!" he exclaimed, turning on the engine and driving us away.I couldn't wait. On the ride to his house, I kept my hand at his thigh, gradually moving it up and down his bulge, making him blush and sigh and getting him excited for what was to come (literally). You could cut the sexual tension in that car with a knife. Eventually, we got to his house. He parked his car and we walked to his front door holding hands.The moment we stepped through the threshold it felt like all of our inhibitions disappeared. He kicked the door closed and pushed me up against it, kissing me deeply. His tongue, no longer shy, explored my mouth, now with more passion than before. He ran his hands down my back, at last coming to rest on my ass. He squeezed it and kneaded it in his hands, making me gasp. I smiled. Well, if that's how it's gonna be. I kissed him harder and began unbuttoning his shirt. Once done I put my hands on his wonderfully sculpted chest, feeling his pecs and abs, then slowly sliding down to his belt. Using both hands this time, I began to undo it. Now the only sounds heard in the house were kissing, panting, and the clinking sounds of his belt buckle. I finally undid it and slid my hand down the front of his pants, finding with surprise that his big package was tightly encased in..."A jockstrap?" I asked, panting.He smiled smugly. "I know what you like." He kissed me again, a small peck, and said, "Now I think it's time we take this to the bedroom."He grabbed my hand and led me upstairs to his room. Once there we were all over each other again. We kissed passionately, ran our hands all over each other's bodies, groping and squeezing and stroking everything we could get our hands on. We fell on the bed, still kissing, him on his back and me on top of him. We pulled away for a moment and he slid off his shirt, exposing his perfectly sculpted muscles. I gradually began to make my way down his body, kissing his jaw, his neck, his collarbones, until I found his pecs and went to town. I licked and sucked and kissed them, taking a nipple in my mouth and tweaking it, making him moan. I finally did what I'd wanted to do for forever and put my face between them, enveloping myself in him. It felt like all my dreams were coming true. I moved down to his abs, licking and kissing them, making him squirm with pleasure and rewarding me with some small moans. And then finally I got to his pants. I hooked my fingers on the waistband and pulled them down, revealing the jock beneath.His big cock was straining against the thin cloth of the pouch. I could even make out the silhouette of it, tightly bound in its cloth prison. I traced my finger along its outline, teasing him and making him gasp. A little wet spot had formed, evidently precum from our excitement. I licked the pouch and put my mouth on it, sucking on it, getting a small taste of what was to come. But then he pushed my head away and said, "Okay, that's enough teasing," hooked his fingers on his jock and pulled it down, gradually revealing his thick shaft until SMACK! It came free and hit me in the face."Now suck me," he said in a domineering tone."Gladly," I said, barely hearing myself.My full focus was now on his magnificent cock. Seven thick inches of meat standing at a perfect ninety-degree angle from his body, protruding from a thicket of dark curly hair. The subject of all my dreams, it curved up at an angle that can hit all of my sweet spots perfectly. And his balls! Two big heavy egg-sized balls hanging low from the base, perfect for cupping and massaging. And the delicious sweaty odor of hormonal teenage sweat coming from it all! Perfect.I started at the base, tracing along his length with my tongue all the way to the head. Once there I began to gently tease at his slit, flicking my tongue on it and catching the stray beads of precum that oozed from it. Finally I circled the head with my tongue and went down, taking his thick cock in my throat, all the way to the base this time."Oohhhh fuck, you're so good at that," he whispered while running his hands through my hair, encouraging me to keep going.I came back up for air, leaving a string of saliva hanging between my mouth and his dick. I grabbed it and gave it a couple strokes, running my fingers up and down his thick shaft before going down again, this time with not as much depth. I wrapped my lips around it and ran my tongue all around his sensitive head, hitting all of his own sweet spots."Oohh fuck dude!" he moaned, responding to the pleasure I was giving him, "Fuck yeah!"I kept that up for a while, servicing his thick cock and stretching out my throat, but then I moved on down to his balls. I pulled away and licked a trail from the head down to the base, and then I began working on them. I licked and sucked on them, I took them in my mouth, I played with them, massaged them, all while he stroked his dick above me. More than once he slapped his heavy dick on my face, since he knew I liked that, to signal for me to keep going, but I wanted to drag this out as long as I could, but eventually I couldn't resist and finally gave in. I licked back up again and took him down to the root, crushing my nose against his pubes and my chin on his balls. 'Fuck, this is where I want to be all my life,' I thought. I came back up for air when I couldn't take it anymore but went immediately back down again. And then he put his hands on the sides of my head and began to buck his hips upwards. He held my head in place and fucked my mouth, thrusting his dick down my throat. Occasionally he would stop and let me breathe for a few seconds before he kept going, his dick hitting the back of my throat and his pubes hitting my nose. Slobber ran down my chin and tears welled in my eyes. This was messy in the best possible way."Mmf! Ohh! Ah! Fuck! Oh god, Isaac!" he moaned, and stopped."Huh? What's wrong?" I asked, panting, saliva still running down my chin."I got way too close, and I don't want this to end yet.""Well, what might you want to do next, I wonder?" I asked teasingly."Oh, you know what comes next. Move. Over," he said devilishly.He got up from the bed, his still hard dick bouncing up and down, and moved towards the end of the bed. He grabbed the waistband of my jeans, pulled them down with my underwear, and began attacking my ass. He pulled my legs up and spit on my hole, rubbing it in and teasing it. Then he began to use his tongue. He licked around it and on it, and then it went in and he really began to rim me. I became a mess from the pleasure his tongue was giving me and began to moan like crazy. He could really work his tongue on me. He stopped for a moment, leaving me panting. I heard a drawer open and close and then a little pop of a lid opening. Next thing I knew he pushed in one of his fingers, no doubt prep for the pounding he was going to give me. He began to pump it in and out of me, quickly adding a second finger after, curling them just so. They quickly began to hit that magic spot and made me see stars. I couldn't take it anymore."Please Bryce! I can't take it anymore! Put it in me!" I begged, needing his big dick inside me."Eager, are we?" he said, slightly amused."Yes! Please! I need you in me!""Well, you did use the magic word, so..."After saying this he pulled his fingers out and began to lube up his dick. Then he put more lube on my hole to prepare it. We were going bareback this time. Finally, what I'd been waiting for. He lined up his dick with my hole, poking at it with the head. Already stretched out, it didn't need it to be slow. I was ready. Suddenly, he thrust into me all the way in and slammed against my ass."FUCK YES!" I moaned.He began to pound into me harder than ever. He grabbed my ankles and pushed them back, spreading my ass further. At this angle his cock was hitting my prostate hard at every thrust, making me see stars. At this point I couldn't even hear myself moan. I was lost in the pleasure he was giving me. And then he began to use longer and longer thrusts until he would leave just the head inside and then slam back in as hard as he could. I could feel his balls slap hard against my ass and the bed shake under us and thump against the wall from his thrusts. We were making so much noise, but we didn't care. We were free to do whatever we wanted all around the house. Which is exactly what we did. He leaned closer to me while slowing down and grinding and kissed me passionately. Then, still kissing me, he wrapped his hands around my back and lifted me up. He then began to bounce me up and down on his thick cock while standing up as I held on to the back of his neck. I moaned into our kiss, breaking it, and he pulled away."FUCK yeah," he growled, "I'm gonna fuck you all over my house."All I could do was moan louder, since he had begun to fuck me harder in the air. He kept fucking me as he walked, grinding into me and kissing me. I don't know how, but to be fair I practically weighed nothing compared to him. He walked out of his room, through the hallway and into the bathroom. He then sat me on the counter and pinned my hands with his to the mirror and started fucking me. His hard thrusts began shaking the counter and shelves of the bathroom so that soon lotion and shampoo bottles were falling off the shelves. He started to pound into me even harder. I even began to slide down the counter from the force of his thrusts, making me moan every time he slammed back into me. But then the rattling became too much to be comfortable, so he picked me back up again, holding me by my ass.While still fucking me he began to go down the stairs, and when we got to the landing he let me down, flipped me over and pushed me up against the railing overlooking his living room. Pretty soon he was fucking me as hard as before, pounding his thick cock into me so hard my feet began to slip. Luckily I held on to the banister, but not before he put his hands on my hips and began to thrust them into his cock, making me feel like his own personal sex toy. Pretty soon he began to use longer thrusts, making sure I felt every inch of his big dick going in and out of me, and then slamming back in."FUCK YES!" I moaned after a particularly hard thrust that sent waves of pleasure through my body."Oh FUCK yeah!" he yelled into the empty house as he fucked me. My moans and his yells echoed throughout the house. For a moment I was worried the neighbors might hear, but then I realized that I didn't care. I was living out my dreams right now, riding on the waves of pleasure Bryce sent through me at every thrust. I soon began to meet him at every thrust, making him moan louder. Soon he leaned in and began whispering things in my ear:"I'm gonna fuck you so hard you won't be able to walk, and every time you sit down you're gonna be reminded of me, and you're gonna crave this dick every day.""OH FUCK! BRYCE!" I moaned louder.He pulled out and picked me up in his arms again. I could feel his hard muscles rippling under his skin as he carried me. He walked down to the living room and bent me over his white leather couch. He quickly put his dick back in me and then began fucking me even harder than before. He pummeled my ass, sending wave after wave of pleasure through my body. I was moaning loudly, no longer hearing myself. The couch began to thump against the floor in time with his thrusts, and I could hear the end table rattle from the force. He put his hands on my shoulders and pulled them upwards and towards him making me arch my back, which gave him the perfect angle to my prostate. Every time he slammed into me I could feel him hitting that magic spot inside me, making me deranged from the pleasure. Pretty soon I was close to my orgasm.
"OH GOD!! BRYCE!! I'M GONNA CUM!"He slammed into me one more time and I exploded. Ropes of cum shot out of my dick, coating the couch beneath us and sending unbelievable pressure through my body. Meanwhile Bryce never stopped fucking me. The force of my orgasm made my muscles clench around his dick, getting him closer to his own cum. And I needed it in me. Soon he began to make shallower thrusts as he neared his orgasm, and then..."FUCK! SHIT! I'M SO CLOSE!" Bryce panted, "WHERE DO YOU WANT IT!?""INSIDE!!""FUCK!! OOHHH FUCK!! I'M CUMMING!!"He thrust in balls deep and soon he was pumping shot after shot of his cum inside me. He thrust in once more and then we both collapsed on the couch, panting and sweating from our intense fuck. I don't know how long we laid there on his white leather couch, him still inside me, catching our breath. After a while, he mustered up the strength to stand back up and pull out. Suddenly I felt a cold breeze and an emptiness I had never quite felt before, and then I felt his cum begin to leak out of me, dripping down my balls. I could tell he wobbled for a bit, and then he lay back on top of me and wrapped his hands around me. I could tell he was about to say something, but he hesitated. After a while, he finally broke the silence."Isaac, I...um...I think..." he sighed, "I think I'm in love with you."I was honestly a little surprised by his sudden openness. A few days ago I still thought he was the hot straight jock I could never have. I turned my head to look at him. My surprise must have shown on my face because he quickly said, "I know it's too early to say anything, but I really really like you and--"I kissed him. A gentle, loving kiss. When I pulled back he was wide-eyed, and it was like there were stars in his eyes."I love you too, Bryce" I said, and I meant it. Maybe not for forever, but right now that's completely what I felt."And I wanna spend time with you, and date you, and laugh with you, and get fucked by you," I continued.He chuckled a little at that."And, speaking of...I think we should get cleaned up by now."He made a sad face. "But I wanna stay here with youuuu.""I know, I know, me too! But I have a curfew!""It's a quarter past ten, you're fine!""Ehh fine. I guess we can stay like this a little longer.""Yay!" he said, and kissed me again.And we did. We laid there for like fifteen more minutes, basking in the afterglow and chatting, and then we (reluctantly) got up and went to get cleaned up. We took a very sexually-charged shower together where we kissed a lot and teased each other, and then we got dressed and left. He drove me home, like a true gentleman, and we kissed goodbye before I went inside.The next day we had a talk about our relationship and whether we wanted it to be public or private. We decided we wouldn't mind being public. I told my parents about us, who already suspected I hadn't quite gone out with friends the day before, and he came out to his parents as bisexual and told them about our relationship. Both sets of parents were both very supportive! We also sort-of-not-really publicly came out as a couple! That next day we walked into school together, holding hands. We got some strange looks, but nothing else happened.My dreams had basically come true. A hot boyfriend, amazing sex, and full acceptance from our peers! It's great! I hope whomever's reading this gets the same thing. (Or maybe just the hot sex part, that one's great too)
