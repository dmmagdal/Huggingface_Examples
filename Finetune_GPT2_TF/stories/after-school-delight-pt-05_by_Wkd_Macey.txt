(Revised)Stacey:A few weeks earlier, unbeknown to either Angie or myself, her mam had met with Harriet Stacey. What sparked this off was something that we were foolish enough to let her overhear. We had been talking about how interesting gym sessions had become since Miss Stacey had taken over the class, not realising that she was in earshot, but we just referred to her as Stacey."Who is Stacey?" Jenny asked, sounding interested. "Is she one of your girlfriends?" she teased."She's a teacher," I told her."A teacher!" she exclaimed, sounding surprised."She's our Gymnastics Mistress," Angie added, giggling."Hmmm. Mistress eh?" Jenny teased, but we ignored the weakly implied innuendo."Not ours really," I told her. "She mostly takes the juniors, but for the last few weeks our usual teacher has been off. That's Miss Delaney, so Stacey has been taking us.""And she seems to like keeping someone behind after school," Angie continued, giggling, "doesn't she," she added, winking at me.Yes she does, I agreed, although I have no idea what for, I told her feigning an innocent tone, while rubbing my groin and crossing my legs."Hmmm..." Jenny mused. "Maybe I ought to have a word with this Miss Stacey," she grinned.We thought nothing more of it at the time.Apparently, Tuesday is the day that the lower seniors have gym class. I discovered this when I subsequently heard about Jenny's impromptu visit to our school. The reason why I only learned of this later, should become clear toward the end of this chapter.It must have been about four in the afternoon when Jenny arrived outside the school that Tuesday. Almost everyone else had left for the day when she came across a couple of girls who were just leaving the grounds. They were dressed in the senior uniform - a black pleated skirt and white blouse, with their St. Bartholomew school ties draped loosely around open-necked blouses. A pair of black patent buckle-top shoes and white socks completed the picture of nubile innocence, but as Jenny would later discover, they were far from this.She assumed them to be from one of the senior classes, simply because juniors would hardly be permitted to dress in such a provocative manner. They both had bleached blonde hair, tied back into a pony tail with a black elastic tie. They looked so similar that they could easily have been sisters, but they weren't.Jenny looked them up and down and smiled, asking where she might find Miss Stacey.The two girls exchanged glances and smirked. "She will probably still be in the sports hall," the taller of the pair told her.Jenny politely asked if they could direct her to there. They did better than that - they took her to the door, abandoning her at the entrance."This is it," the taller girl told her. "You'll find Miss Stacey in there," she said."Somewhere," the other girl added."Although, what she'll be doing," the first girl added, "could be anyone's guess."The pair then left Jenny to find her own way. Apparently they were giggling when they departed. To be honest I'm not really that surprised. They probably knew what was likely to be going on inside the hall.It seems that when Jenny eventually came across Miss Stacey, she was talking to a girl who was just coming out of the showers.On entering the gym, Jenny had heard voices and simply followed the sounds."Why are you still here?" a severe sounding woman was asking. "You know everyone else has gone. No-one is allowed in here after classes."Rather than just burst in, Jenny decided to wait and listen."The other girls told me to wait here?" came the reply from a very much younger, timid sounding female voice."Other girls?" the woman queried."Carol Price and Emily Richards," the girl explained."Really?" came the surprised and interested response. "Those two little alley cats," the woman commented. "And why might that be, I wonder?" she added."I don't know," came the girl's reply. "They said you might want to see me.""Well they would be right about that," the woman's voice returned."Please Miss? May I go and get dressed now?" the girl asked. "I'll be late home.""Not yet," the woman told her. "We're not done here yet. Not by a long chalk." There was a pause. "Well? Come on then. Let me have a look at you!"After another short pause, the woman's voice said, "Oh! Very...""Hello?" Jenny called, as she decided at that point to interrupt proceedings, and enter the shower room.The young girl gasped in surprise, quickly clasping a towel around her, as the woman whirled around.The woman was probably in her late thirties or early forties, rather thick set for a gym instructor or so Jenny thought, which is what she assumed the woman to be. She was about five and a half feet tall, with dark brown hair, which was slicked back over her ears in a fairly unflattering style. Well, to be honest, it wasn't a style at all really, and she wore a shocking pink and navy track suit, which was completely out of character with her severe and almost masculine appearance. Not Jenny's type at all, in fact. We all know by now that Jenny prefers much younger, petite little babes, more like the cute little nymphette that this woman had trapped in her lair right now, but hey - any port in a storm, eh?From what Angie and I had told her previously, there was little doubt in Jenny's mind that this woman was the infamous Miss Stacey."What are you doing in here?" the teacher called out in a scolding tone, which softened a little when she realised that it wasn't one of her peers or minions who she was talking to."Can I help you?" she asked, as her manner mellowed. "Are you looking for someone?""I'm trying to find a Miss Stacey. Would that be you?" Jenny asked.The slender little brunette who was with her, looked horrified. Jenny looked the girl up and down, admiring her fresh, young appearance, and enjoying her apparent vulnerability. She had a slightly oriental look about her, but otherwise seemed veryEnglish. It was obvious she must be naked beneath the towel that she hugged around her wet body, a cascade of long, straggly, almost black hair tumbling down over bare, creamy coloured shoulders.Jenny smiled, and the girl reciprocated nervously.The woman couldn't help but notice Jenny's obvious interest in the girl, eventually replying, "Err... Yes. I am Harriet Stacey. May I know who is asking?""My name is Jenny Bolton. I wondered if we could have a little chat?""Of course," Miss Stacey replied, recognising the surname. "Wendy. Would you mind waiting in the changing room please?" she asked of the girl. "We can go to my office," Stacey told Jenny, leading the way.As they entered the small office adjacent to the changing room, Miss Stacey turned to confront Jenny, with an air of authority. "Now," she began. "What is this all about?""Let's just say, I'm interested in some extra-curricula activities, shall we?" Jenny told her."Oh really?" Stacey replied, clearly thinking that Jenny was looking to procure some further tuition for one of her students. 'This sounds promising', the teacher thought. "What sort of extra-curricula activity did you have in mind? Who is the girl?" Stacey asked.Jenny smiled. "I think perhaps you may have misunderstood? I was more interested in the extra curricular activities that I understand you have already been undertaking with the senior form."Stacey's expression changed instantly as her face coloured up. "I really don't know what you mean," she replied, although there was a definite nervous tremor in her voice."I think you do know," Jenny challenged her, smiling. "I'm talking about the sort of extra-curricula activities that you were about to get involved in with that young girl just now. The one you sent to the changing room," Jenny smiled."This is preposterous!" the woman objected. "I was merely talking to the child.""I know," Jenny agreed. "I heard you. And if I hadn't come along to interrupt you, you would have probably had your fingers inside her while you were talking, wouldn't you, Jenny told her."I think I'm going to have to ask you to leave," Miss Stacey blurted, angrily."Fingering young schoolgirls in the showers?" Jenny continued. "Is that what gym teachers are supposed to do? What are you teaching them? How to get off with each other?""Get out!" Stacey demanded, shouting angrily."Oh, surely not, Jenny reasoned, almost laughing. "At least not until you've heard everything I have to say.""I don't care what you have to say," Stacey replied, abruptly."Really?" Jenny countered. "I feel sure it would be in your best interests to at least listen," she insisted. "You wouldn't want me to raise the matter with the Head would you? ... Or the school governors, perhaps?"Stacey stopped in her tracks."Yes... I thought that might make you see reason. You see, I don't intend to create any problems. I simply thought we could have a little chat." Stacey stared at her, red faced. "It's just that..." Jenny paused, "well, it's a bit delicate," she explained. "You see... Well... I think you and I may have a sort of... common interest?"Stacey began to look curious. "Go on?" she replied, cautiously."Well... I have... how should I put this? I have a... shall we say, a certain talent, when it comes to convincing people to..." she paused again, adding, "comply?""And?" Stacey prompted."And you, my dear," Jenny proposed, "you have access to a number of things," she said, nodding toward the door beyond which the cute young girl was waiting, "that we seem to both be interested in," she smiled."Hmmm," Stacey mused."I wondered if perhaps we might pool our resources, so to speak?" Jenny suggested."And why, pray," Stacey asked, "might I be tempted to share any of the things that I have access to?""Because my dear..." Jenny explained, "Because I can make it so much easier to take full advantage of those things," she smiled.Stacey looked doubtful. "How so?" she asked."Would you like me to demonstrate?" Jenny offered."Please do," Stacey smiled, now clearly interested."Call the girl in," Jenny told her.Harriet Stacey opened the door to the changing room. "Wendy?" she called."Yes Miss Stacey?" the girl answered."Would you like to come and meet... an acquaintance of mine?" she called.The young girl stepped forward to the doorway. She was now fully dressed and looking cuter than ever, wearing a fairly large pair of dark rimmed glasses. "I thought I should get ready to go home," she said nervously, "as it's getting late. My mum will wonder where I am.""Quite right," Jenny replied, "but no need to be concerned about that just now my dear," she told the girl. "Come. Let me look at you."Wendy walked up to Jenny, who placed her hands on the girl's shoulders. "My, don't you look lovely," Jenny told her. "How old are you child?" she asked."I'm eighteen Ma'am," the girl replied."Really?" Jenny expressed an element of surprise. "You don't look eighteen.""Well... I'm nearly eighteen," Wendy conceded."Oh. But that would mean you're in a senior class aren't you? Does that mean you're in the same class with my Angela?""Angela Bolton? No Ma'am," the girl replied. "Angela is in the 'A' class. I'm in the 'B' class.""But, you're all the same age, aren't you?""Yes Ma'am."I thought all the senior girls were eighteen," Jenny queried."We are. Well... all except me, that is. I'm the youngest. It's my birthday in two days. Then I'll be eighteen," Wendy told her."On Thursday?" Jenny queried."Yes ma'am," the girl replied. "I know I don't look it. I've always been small for my age," she explained.Jenny smiled. "Just like someone else I know," she told the girl, then turning to Stacey she whispered, "She's perfect.""Isn't she though," Stacey agreed."And I suppose you'll be having a wild party, will you?" Jenny went on."No ma'am.""Oh? And why not, may I ask? Could it be that your parents are Asian?" Jenny asked, probing subtly about the girl's oriental appearance."My mum is Korean, but that's not why," she replied. "My parents just don't believe in personal celebration," she said."Oh. That is such a pity. But I imagine you would like to celebrate, wouldn't you?""I would like to, of course Ma'am, but I won't be allowed.""Well..." she paused, turning briefly to look at the teacher, "I think we might be able to help you with that," Jenny told her."How do you mean?" the girl asked, innocently.Jenny placed a finger under the girl's chin. "Look at me child," she told her. "What do you see?""I'm not sure," Wendy replied, in a puzzled tone. "You?"Jenny smiled. "Look closely. Look into my eyes," she said. "What do you see now?"Wendy appeared confused."Freedom my dear. You see freedom."The girl looked bewildered."Look into my eyes, and try to relax." Wendy obeyed. "Don't you feel relaxed my dear?" Jenny asked."Yes. Yes, I suppose I do," Wendy replied."Of course you do. You feel happy and relaxed."Wendy nodded slowly. Stacey looked impressed."You don't really want to go home yet, do you?""No," Wendy replied softly. She looked calm and subdued."No. Of course not. You want to find out what lovely surprises we have here for you, don't you," Jenny told her.Wendy nodded again."You want to find out what wonderful experiences we can offer, don't you."Again the girl nodded."Come," Jenny beckoned her, stroking the wet hair as she slid an arm around the girl's shoulders. "Tell me," she asked. "When was the first time you kissed a boy?"Wendy looked up into her eyes and shook her head. "Never," she said."Oh my. What have you been missing?" she prompted. "Have you ever kissed anyone?""Only my mum," she replied."Hmmm... Mum's don't count," Jenny told her. "Haven't you even kissed another girl?""No," Wendy replied, looking unsure."Well, we'll have to remedy that, won't we," she smiled, looking at Stacey."Yes, we certainly will," the teacher agreed, watching with enormous interest."Come child," Jenny instructed. "Come closer."She placed a helping finger under the girl's chin and moved her face close, their lips almost touching. "Aren't you just a little bit excited?" she asked.Wendy smiled as she nodded."Of course you are. But, we can't do this now, can we.""We can't?" Wendy questioned her, looking confused.Jenny shook her head as she smiled, looking into the innocent eyes. "No my pretty. I'm afraid we can't. Not here. Not just now.""Why not?" the girl asked."Because, my lovely..." she turned to look at Stacey, who appeared thoroughly annoyed. "Because," she said, turning back to the girl, "one thing often leads to another, and before we know it, we might find ourselves doing naughty things that underage girls shouldn't do," Jenny told her.Wendy looked disappointed. "I'm not really underage," she reasoned. "Only by two days.""It's still two days though, isn't it," Jenny countered, "and there are some things that adults are not allowed to do with girls who are not of consenting age yet... even if is is only two days to their birthday." She smiled sympathetically at the girl. "You know the sort of things I mean, don't you?" she added.Wendy nodded, pouting slightly."You would like to do some of those... naughty things though... wouldn't you?" Jenny asked.Wendy smiled and nodded."Well, if you're really eighteen on Thursday, why don't you come back here after school on Thursday, and we can have a special eighteenth birthday party here... just for you."Wendy smiled, nodding again.Jenny turned to Stacey. "Miss Stacey," she began," why don't you write a small note for Wendy? You could say something like, there's a special gym practice for the seniors on Thursday, and you would like Wendy to be present because she's doing so well with her gymnastics.""Hmmm. Yes, that's a good idea," Stacey agreed."Then, Jenny continued, you can spend an hour or so with us, and we can give you the best coming-of-age birthday present ever. Would you like that?"Wendy nodded happily. "Oh yes please," she agreed."And," Jenny went on, "I'll make sure my daughter Angela is here. Do you know her?""Isn't she the one who's always with that small girl, Macey?" Wendy asked."Yes, that's right.""I don't really know her, but I've seen her around.""That's good then. I'll make sure they are both here. You can meet them. I'm sure you will all get on very well together."Jenny turned to Stacey. "Does that sound OK to you?"Miss Stacey nodded. "Sounds perfect," she smiled, looking excited."Now, I wonder," Jenny began, looking at the girl with puzzled expression. "Do you shave?""I'm not a man!" Wendy giggled."No child, I mean, body hair," Jenny laughed, kindly."Oh. You mean under the arms?""Well... yes, but... other places too.""Other places?" Wendy asked, looking confused."You know where I mean," Jenny smiled. "Down here," she said, touching herself low on her groin with her fingertips."Oh!" Wendy exclaimed. "Oh no. I've never done that," she replied, looking slightly embarrassed."Well, maybe you might like to have a try... before Thursday?""Oh. OK," the girl agreed. "But..." she stopped to consider the idea, "why would I need to do that?" she asked."Because, my sweet," Jenny told her, looking serious, "I don't much like hair in my mouth.""Oh," the girl replied with a smile and a hesitant laugh, feeling a little foolish at not having immediately understood. A second later she stopped and gasped, wide-eyed, placing both hands over her mouth as it suddenly dawned on her precisely what Jenny had meant."Oh! she gasped again, this time the tone conveying her realisation of the full implication of Jenny's words.
"You are happy with that, aren't you?" Jenny asked, bending low to face the girl, and slipping an arm around her narrow shoulders. Wendy smiled, nervously. Her face was flushed red, but she gulped and nodded, replying, "Yes ma'am." "Call me Mama," Jenny told her. "But you're not my mother." "Not Mother my sweet. Mama." "Oh. OK," Wendy agreed, smiling. "And in the morning, after you've got rid of all that nasty fluffy stuff, you can get up really early, before anyone else in the house is awake, and have a shower." "Oh. We don't have a shower," the girl revealed. "OK, run a bath then," Jenny suggested. "You do have a bath, don't you?" she joked. "Of course," Wendy giggled. "Well then, while your bath is running, you can take off your dressing gown and nightie, and watch yourself in the mirror." "Watch myself? Doing what?" she asked. "Doing what young girls who have just turned eighteen, like to do when they wake early in the morning, and no-one else is around." "Oh," Wendy said, slowly, looking decidedly bashful. "I don't really do that sort of thing." "Don't be silly child. There's no need to be embarrassed. We all do that. What do you think we'll be doing on your birthday?" Wendy looked away, then down at the floor. "Don't be shy, The important thing is, to enjoy yourself. Mind you don't get carried away and let the bath run over though," Jenny laughed, kindly. "No ma'am," Wendy smiled, looking decidedly red in the face. "Call me Mama," Jenny reminded her. "Sorry. No Mama," Wendy corrected herself. "Then you need to get into the bath, kneel down with your knees apart, lower yourself into the water, and clean yourself down there." "You mean here?" Wendy asked, touching her groin. "That's right. But mind you do it properly now. You have to be really clean for your party. But you have to be careful too. Don't push too deep will you. You don't want to damage anything do you." "Damage?" she asked. "You know what I mean. You have to save that part of yourself, don't you." "What for?""For your one true love, my sweet. That part of you, you need to save for the one you will eventually give yourself to... completely." Wendy looked perplexed. "You do understand why, don't you?" Jenny asked. "I think so," the girl replied. "So you want me to wash myself?" "That's right." "Inside?" "Yes my sweet. Inside," Jenny affirmed. "But I have to be careful." "Of course my sweet. You know why you have to be clean there, don't you?" "Is it so that I'm nice and fresh for you?" Jenny nodded. "Why do imagine I might want you to be fresh down there?" "Are you going to kiss me there?" Wendy asked. "That's right sweetie. I want to kiss you there... because I imagine your body must be very beautiful..." she paused again, smiling at the girl, "and because," she added, "I simply love the taste of fresh young pussy." Wendy forced a smile, but it was plain to see she was very nervous about the idea of having someone do that. "You are happy for me to do that, aren't you?" Jenny asked, looking concerned. The girl nodded. "If you really want to," she agreed. "Oh I do my love. I really do." She reached out and hugged Wendy, whispering into her ear, "I can see we're going to have such wonderful fun together, you and I," she smiled as she released the girl from her embrace. Wendy looked uneasy, shuffling her feet and squeezing her knees together. "What's wrong sweetie?" Jenny asked. "Are you getting a little..." she paused, adding the word, "horny?" smiling as she turned to look at Miss Stacey, who was clearly also becoming aroused. Wendy nodded. "You !b>are looking forward to your birthday, aren't you?" "I am now," Wendy replied, crossing her legs slightly as she stood facing them, awkwardly. "I wonder," Jenny prompted. "Is there, perhaps, something you'd like to ask me?" "Couldn't you do it now?" Wendy replied, a slight tremble in her voice. Stacey looked as though she was about to move forward to take the girl at her word, but Jenny raised a hand to stop her. "Well... I suppose we could take you back into the changing room, she said slowly, and we could possibly undress you there." She paused, watching the idea of it making changes to Wendy's expressions. "Perhaps you'd like it if we were to spread you out across a bench and bestow a thousand pleasures upon you?" Wendy crossed her legs and began fidgeting where she stood. "Oh please. Yes please," she moaned softly. Stacey stepped forward, keen to oblige, but Jenny stopped her again. "But, I'm afraid we can't really do that... can we," she told the girl solemnly. "Why not?" Wendy asked, looking devastatingly disappointed. "Well, sweetie," Jenny told her. "I'm afraid, until Thursday, you're still underage. Miss Stacey and I could get into lots of trouble, couldn't we." "I wouldn't tell anyone. I promise," Wendy appealed. She looked at Stacey, who smiled back. Clearly, now that Wendy was primed and ready, the older woman was eager to help her student to achieve her dreams. "I'm sure you mean that my sweet," Jenny told her, "but there's another, more important reason why we can't do any of those things. Not yet anyway." "What is it?" Wendy asked, searching for some logical rationale in her head. "Yes," Stacey echoed. "What's the problem?" "Well, you see," Jenny began to explain, "if we did any of those naughty things with you today..." she paused, "we could never share our experiences with anyone else." "What do you mean?" Stacey asked. "Well, you know there are lots of people who like to read about the sort of naughty adventures we'll be getting up to on your birthday Wendy," she explained, looking at the girl. "Err... I suppose so," she conceded. "Well, if we were to do those things today, we would never be able to have our story published." "Oh no!" the girl exclaimed. "You can't tell anyone about it," she objected. "I could never show my face again if anyone knew what we'd been doing." "Oh, don't be silly," Jenny laughed, kindly. "We won't use your real name," she smiled, "nor the name of the school." Wendy seemed happier at that. "But..." Jenny went on, "you see why we can't give you these gifts early, don't you?" "I suppose so," Wendy sighed, realising the problem. "So... it would be much better if you can wait, wouldn't it?" Wendy sighed again, resigning herself to the fact that rules are rules, and we simply can't break them. "You can manage to wait just a couple more days, can't you?" Jenny asked. "I suppose I'll have to," Wendy sighed. "There's my good girl," Jenny encouraged her, "and if you really can't wait, then maybe you could go and practice shaving, and maybe have an early bath?" she smiled. "OK," Wendy replied, albeit a little sulkily. "Now child. You won't forget now, will you?" "No ma'am," she replied expectantly. "Call me Mama," Jenny reminded her. "Sorry. No Mama." "Better run home now, before we're tempted to do something that we might regret." "Why?" "No questions. Just come on Thursday, as we agreed." "And shave in the morning?" Wendy queried. "Probably better to do it on Wednesday evening," Jenny suggested. "Why not in the morning?" Wendy asked. "Have you ever shaved yourself there before?" Jenny asked. Wendy shook her head. "You'll need to go slowly the first time you do it," Jenny advised her. "We don't want to rush something like that, do we? You need to take care the first few times... until you get practiced at it." "Oh, OK," Wendy agreed. "How should I do it?" she asked. "Does your mum have a thing called a Ladyshave?" Jenny asked. "I think so." "Well, borrow that then," Jenny smiled, encouragingly. "I don't think I could ask her for that. She'd want to know what I wanted it for." "You probably need to borrow it without her knowing." "Couldn't you do it for me?" Wendy asked, "when I come here on my birthday?" Jenny shook her head. "We won't have long here on Thursday," she told the girl, "and we don't want to waste our time doing something like that, do we," she smiled. "We want to use all the time we have making you feel good. Don't you think?" "OK," Wendy agreed, her face beaming with the broadest smile. "Good girl," Jenny told her. "So, you're all set?" Wendy nodded. "Good. Then, when you come to school on Friday, make sure you bring a weekend bag with you." "What for?" "So that you can come and stay with Angela and I of course," Jenny told her. "Tell your mum that you've been invited to spend the weekend with a friend from the gymnastics team, because you want to practice some moves." "Really?" "Yes my dear. On Thursday we're going to give you a birthday party to remember for all your life. And on Friday, and all weekend, Angela and I will make you wonder how you ever lived without weekends with us." Jenny smiled. "We're going to show you some moves that you'll never forget," Jenny told her, smiling lustily. "Oh, and by the way...""Yes Mama?" "Good girl. You remembered," Jenny congratulated her. "When you see those two girls again, what were their names?" "Carol and Emily?" "Yes, those two. If they ask how you got on today, you be sure to tell them you had a wonderful time and you really enjoyed it, and thank them very much for arranging it for you." Wendy laughed as she turned to leave, smiling back over her shoulder at them, with Jenny waving her a fond farewell. Harriet Stacey was clearly not quite so happy to see the girl depart, but she kept her feelings hidden - at least for the moment. As soon as Wendy was out of sight, Harriet turned to Jenny to ask quietly, almost in a whisper, "How on earth did you manage that?" "Oh, did I not mention. I have certain... talents, in that area," Jenny smiled. "But, that was amazing. I bet you could have got her to do anything you wanted." "It can be rather... advantageous," Jenny agreed, smugly, "but it's not quite as indomitable as it may seem at first sight." "Well, it looked to me as if you had her in the palm of your hand," Harriet told her. "She was," Jenny agreed, "but it doesn't work with everyone, and it isn't completely overwhelming." "How so?" Harriet asked, clearly curious. "Well, for example, the mind has to be fairly receptive to start with. It works better on younger, more impressionable subjects," she explained. "You mean, young girls?" Harriet smiled, lewdly. "Girls, boys, whoever," Jenny replied, choosing to ignore Harriet Stacey's lecherous overtones. "All that is required is a relatively open mind." "Open?" Harriet queried. "That probably wasn't quite the right word? Perhaps malleable would a better term," Jenny explained. "And they have to be susceptible to the idea too, of course. I can't simply make a person do anything that I wish, at least not against their will or inner nature. All I can do is... shall we say, assist them in overcoming their inhibitions," she smiled. "Like getting them to let you have sex with them?" Harriet said, pointedly. "Perhaps," Jenny agreed, smiling. "They have to be receptive to the idea first, though. As I said, I can't make someone do anything that they wouldn't want to." "Pity," Harriet mused under her breath. "Fortunately for the likes of you and I, most young girls have a latent tendancy toward lesbianism." "Really?" Harriet replied. "Of course. Did you not realise that?" The woman shook her head. "Surely you must have noticed that girls tend to couple up. You've seen them walking arm-in-arm together. And of course, most people like young girls." Stacey looked puzzled. "Boys, girls, men, women - they are mostly attracted to young girls in one way or another. All the girls need is a little nudge in the right direction. Guide them toward their inner nature, and they can't resist," Jenny went on. "You just have to treat them carefully. You know - give them the right incentive and coax them along," she smiled. Harriet nodded, confirming her agreement. "And, of course," Jenny added, "you have to catch them before they learn how good it feels to have the warmth of a thick, hard cock pounding away inside you," she laughed. "I still don't understand why you let her go though. I mean, that Wendy is such a cute little thing. I was really looking forward to having some fun with her." "And so you shall my dear. So you shall. Don't worry. She'll be back, and next time she'll be a willing partner," Jenny promised the woman. "And legal too," she added with a smirk. "Next time?" Harriet queried. "Thursday." Jenny affirmed "And you have to admit, she wasn't very happy about being here with you, was she," Jenny pointed out. "I suppose not," Stacey agreed. "Is she pretty?" Jenny asked, changing the subject slightly. "Who, Wendy? You saw her," she laughed. "Didn't you think so?" "I didn't see her body," Jenny explained. Harriet smiled. "She's perfect," she replied, smiling wistfully. "A lovely little nymph. Such a beautiful slender body. Firm, ripe little breasts, just the right size to..." Harriet stopped, clearly embarrassed by her own lucidity. "To cup in your hands?" Jenny finished the sentence for her. "I shouldn't be talking to you like this," Harriet told her. "Why not?" Jenny asked. "Didn't I tell you, I think we share the same interests?" "Yes... but..." "But nothing. You can talk to me as openly as you would to yourself," Jenny encouraged. "Go ahead. Tell me exactly what you feel," she told the woman, looking deeply into her eyes. Harriet smiled again, admitting, "I so wanted to squeeze them. To kiss those pretty, pouting lips, and wet my finger in that sweet, tight little hole of hers. I love the idea of making them moan while I'm kissing them," she breathed. "You see Harriet. We do have a common interest," Jenny laughed. Harriet Stacey mused the situation. "My problem is, finding one to play with. One who won't tell," she admitted. "You're taking a bit of a chance though, aren't you?" Jenny suggested. "You mean, coercing girls into letting me have my way with them? Yes, I suppose so." There was a pause. "You know," she went on, "I would never have imagined revealing anything like this to someone I've only just met. I can barely believe we're actually having this conversation." "I do seem to have a surprising knack for putting people at ease, don't I," Jenny told her. There was another pregnant silence for a moment. "Wouldn't you prefer to have a girl give herself voluntarily?" Jenny enquired at last. "Huh! Who's going to do that for me?" Stacey asked, looking decidedly dejected. "You might be surprised," Jenny replied. "You know my daughter Angela, don't you?" "Yes, of course I know Angela. She's in my Thursday class." "What if I told you that Angela would do anything you wanted." "Huh! Stacey retorted. I'll believe that when I see it. Anyway, I wouldn't try anything on with her." "Why not? Isn't she pretty enough?" Jenny sounded offended. "You have to be joking. She's gorgeous." "So? Why not then?" "Well, she's your daughter, to start with," Stacey reasoned. "Wouldn't you be angry?" "Doesn't bother me," Jenny smiled. "I have fun with her all the time." "What? You'd do something like that with your own daughter?" "Why not? Just because we're related, doesn't mean we can't enjoy some good sex together," Jenny laughed. "But... your own daughter?" "Surely you're not suggesting I should deny my own daughters the pleasures that I would give to anyone else?" "Daughters? Plural?" "I have two daughters, and they both like sex... surprisingly enough," Jenny told her, with a sarcastic smirk. "Well," Stacey looked at Jenny sideways, "I still couldn't." Jenny just looked at her, waiting patiently for the reason. "She's always with that little minx Macey. I never see them apart," the woman explained. Stacey's eyes became misty, and she smiled slightly. "You like her, don't you," Jenny observed. "Who? Macey or Angela?""Either. Both," Jenny replied, with a smile. Stacey didn't reply, but Jenny could tell her inner thought was affirmative. "Would you like some fun with them then? Maybe together?" "You could never arrange that," Stacey challenged her. "Why not? I often have whole weekends of threesomes with them." "Could you really get them to do something like that? I don't believe you!" Stacey exclaimed. "Why not give me a chance to prove it on Thursday, then you'll believe it. Trust me. I can convince Angela to do anything I ask of her," Jenny revealed. "Really?" Harriet exclaimed. Jenny ignored the question, posing another. "What do you do with these girls when you get them here?" she asked. Harriet Stacey became very cagey. "Don't be shy. I'm sure it's nothing that I haven't done with scores of girls." "Well... you know... just touching, kissing. You know." "Did you ever eat them?" "What do you mean?" Harriet asked cautiously. "You know what I mean. Do you ever taste their sweet little pussies?" "No! Of course not," Stacey replied. "How about having them do it for you?" Jenny asked, smirking. "Huh! Chance would be a fine thing." "But you've been with girls or other women before, haven't you?" "Not as often as I would have liked." She hesitated. "No. Not really," she admitted at last. "Do you prefer more mature lovers then?" "Oh no. I like sweet young things, but finding a willing partner isn't easy for someone like me." "Well... perhaps I may have the perfect panacea for you," Jenny smiled. "What do you mean?" Harriet replied, looking more interested. "Would you like to have my Angela do that for you?" "Oh my God. That would be so incredible." "You could have them both. Angela and Macey. Maybe you could eat one while the other does the same for you." Jenny smiled. "Get them to take turns," she laughed. "That would be something," Harriet mused. "But honestly," Jenny told her, looking serious. "You really shouldn't put your position here in jeopardy by taking advantage of girls against their will. Heaven knows you're taking a big enough risk by playing with schoolgirls anyway. Don't go putting yourself in even worse danger." Stacey sighed. "You're right I suppose," she conceded. She mused the idea for a moment. "Do you really think you could get your Angela to do something like that for me?" she asked. "Of course," Jenny smiled. "Like I said, my darling daughter will do anything I ask of her. Trust me." "Oh my God. You're making me feel so horny," Harriet replied. There was a brief pause as Jenny looked at the woman's expectant face. "Perhaps I ought to help you with that?" Jenny suggested, albeit reluctantly. "You're not my usual type, but I suppose I could make an exception as you've got me started," she smirked. Harriet moved forward and slipped her arms around Jenny's neck, raising her face and gazing into the captivating eyes in awe. "I'm still not very pleased with you for sending pretty little Wendy home though," the woman complained, with a playful pout. "I was looking forward to some fun with that one." "I told you. She'll be ours. All in good time. But right now she's under age." "Only by a few days," Harriet reasoned. "A few days. A few months. A few years. Where do you draw the line?" Jenny asked. Even as she uttered the words, Jenny was wrestling with her own conscience to ignore the hypocrisy of her seemingly moral statement. "Anyway," she added, finally emerging victorious in her overarching lust for the girl, "we'll have our fun with her soon enough. We'll treat her to an eighteenth birthday party she'll never forget," she grinned. 
Harriet raised her face to Jenny expectantly, and was rewarded by the most sensual kiss imaginable, long and deep."I'm puzzled though," Harriet said, breaking off for a moment. "How did you manage to do that with a girl you've only just met?""Hmmm. You'd be surprised what I can persuade a girl to do if I put my mind to it," Jenny smiled.They kissed again, as Harriet raised a hand to grip one full, firm breast through Jenny's thin summer dress. She squeezed and kneaded it roughly, as Jenny's hand moved down to the woman's crotch, grasping her aching pussy through the track-suit bottom.Polina:Despite Jenny's discomfort at Harriet's indelicate molestation, they began to move together, the gym teacher finding herself rapidly overcome by a sudden, burning passion, but before Jenny similarly allowed herself to become immersed in the moment, a faint sound distracted her.It was like a cross between a whimper and a low moan. She looked up to notice a shadow moving in the doorway. Someone was there, watching them. She could see them moving through a crack in the doorway.Jenny studied the shape. Perhaps a slight breeze may have moved the door a little wider, or something pushed it, but from the light through the enlarged crack she could now see it was a woman. Clearly she had been watching Jenny and Harriet together. The sight of the pair had obviously aroused her, but she was now far more interested in pleasuring herself, completely unaware that she had been spotted.Jenny pulled away from their clinch, raising a finger to her lips in a silent 'shush' gesture, and pointing toward the slightly open door. Harriet smiled and nodded.They moved toward the door as one, silently pulling it open to reveal a dark haired woman, probably mid to late thirties, leaning back against the wall beside the door. She was of average height, with dark hair pulled flat against her head. Her eyes were closed and she was breathing heavily. Her left hand was raised and crossed inside the royal blue tabard that she wore over her light grey tee-shirt, and though obscured by the outer covering, it was obvious that she was fondling her right breast.Her right hand was down inside the front of a pair of elasticated, red flannel shorts, creating a large bulge around the crotch, which was moving slowly and sensually. As the woman moaned softly, her shapely legs parted slightly and her hips moved gently, in sympathy with the hidden hand.It was all Harriet could do to resist giggling, but as they watched her, Jenny realised she knew her. She recognised the slightly triangular features of the woman's face, and those prominently high cheek bones, as belonging to someone she had known from several years ago."Hello Polina," she said softly.There was a horrified squeal from the woman as she looked up, the previous expression of exquisite pleasure on her face instantly changing to one of shocked horror.Polina turned to run but Jenny quickly reached out to grab her arm."Oh, don't leave," Jenny pleaded, smiling kindly. "Come and join us," she suggested."You know this woman?" Harriet asked in surprise."Oh. I am sorry," came the embarrassed East European sounding voice, almost simultaneously, as the woman hurriedly struggled to straighten her clothing. "I think there is no-one here. Sorry," she said again, stepping back hesitantly, as if meaning to leave, but seemingly reluctant to do so."It didn't look as if you thought there was no-one here," Jenny told her, smirking."Polina's daughter and my Angela used to play together years ago, when they were at junior school," Jenny revealed to her companion, smiling, as she and Harriet moved around the woman, virtually trapping her against the wall beside the door.As Polina stood facing them with the light from the office now falling on her, they could see more clearly. The tabard she wore covered a fairly snug fitting tee-shirt, which almost hid a not too generously proportioned bust, below which she wore a relatively loose fitting pair of red flannelette shorts. In beautiful contrast, her very shapely, tanned legs extended down to short white ankle socks and white trainers.Polina smiled bashfully, which served to enhance her ruggedly attractive features, the only slightly negative aspect being a faint aroma of body odour as they approached her. Despite this, Harriet smiled back, lasciviously."What was your girl's name?" Jenny asked."Alysia," Polina replied. "I sorry. I must go now," she stammered, trying to push past them."Don't be in such a hurry to leave," Harriet told the woman, clearly keen to get close to her."I sorry," she said again. "I think nobody is here. Most days everyone has gone by now.""What are you doing here?" Jenny asked."She's the caretaker," Harriet replied for her."No," the woman countered. "I am janitor," she replied, raising her head proudly, while forcing a nervous smile.Jenny smiled back. "Same thing," she said kindly, "but you don't really need to work, do you?""Da! I work now," Polina replied, nodding. "I like to work here.""But, your family are well off. Surely you don't need the money?"Polina hesitated. "No. I like to work," she repeated."Hmmm. Why is that, I wonder? Do you like to be around the girls, perhaps?" Jenny suggested, with a knowing smile.Polina shook her head. She looked embarrassed, but declined to answer."Don't be bashful," Jenny encouraged. "It's good to find someone else who shares our interest, isn't it Harriet," she added, tuning to her sinful new friend.Harriet Stacey just smiled and nodded, still watching Polina closely, eying the woman up and down, and clearly keen to get to know her a little more intimately."Share interest?" Polina queried."Oh, come on," Jenny replied. "Don't play coy with me. You were obviously watching us together," she told Polina, "so clearly you like the idea of two women enjoying some private time together."Polina sighed. "I am..." she paused, searching for the words, "curious," she added, her face flushed with embarrassment."Perhaps you would have liked to join us?" Jenny suggested. Polina didn't reply."Ahhh, but... maybe you were afraid... too shy to come forward... so instead you decided to satisfy that tempting tingle for yourself?"Polina hesitated, until - "I can not help this," the red faced woman admitted at last. "Watching, I mean.""Of course not," Jenny smiled, understanding just how arousing the sight of two women locked in an embrace can be."It was not always like this for me. My life I mean," Polina told them, clearly feeling she should explain. "My first man, he teach me to be this way with girls," she reasoned."He taught you?" Harriet challenged, sounding incredulous."Let me explain," Polina told them. "When I am not yet fourteen, I know this boy. He is one year older than me. I meet him at market where I sell fruit and vegetable that I pick at farm near where I live in Romania. I take to market to sell - earn money for family. I see this boy on market days and we become friends... good friends. No sex. Just hugs and sometimes kisses. Touching a little maybe. Nothing more."She paused, looking wistful, as if recalling a lost love."My father never like me, she went on bitterly, appearing to change the subject. "He say I am not his child. He would beat me but my mother she stop him, so he beat her instead.""Why didn't she leave him?" Harriet asked."Ha! Why not? Romania in those times was not good place. A woman need a man to protect her. Any man better than no man. A woman alone, she get no work. No way to get food. She would have no home, and the men... Oh, the men. Any man can have her. She will be raped every day. She have no choice to stay with him."Anyways, my father he find out. Someone from market tell him about me and this boy. They say I have sex with boy. I tell my father we did not, but he not believe me. He say I must marry. I am only thirteen still.""Your father made you marry a boy of fourteen? At that age?" Harriet challenged in disbelief."No. No. Not the boy. My father say if I am old enough to have sex with boy, then I can marry. Our family are very poor so he find rich man for me. One day when I come home from school my mother she is crying. There are two men in the house. One dressed as priest, but later I think he is not priest.""What made you think he wasn't a priest?" Jenny asked."Because what he did later," Polina explained."Anyway, these men, they look at me. One looks at my father and he nod, and give my father a packet. I know it is money. The other man, the priest, he make me kneel with other man. He say some words I do not understand. I think he is Italian. I not sure. Then my father tell me, now I am married and I must go with the men. My mother is still crying. She give me a hug, and tell me to be good for my new husband. My father tell me I must do all they tell me or I will be sent away. He say if I do not do what they say, they throw me out and I will have no home and no food. The men with no home... what you say?" she asked, searching for a word."Vagrants?" Jenny offered."Da! Vagrants. They will pass me around around for their fun, and... I think you know," she said as her gaze fell to the floor."So I have to go with the men, she resumed. I never see my mother again, My father I do not care, but my mother I miss."I get in their car and the priest get in back with me. The other man drive first. We drive for many miles... long time, and the priest... Ha!" she scoffs. "This priest, he make me do things for him. I cannot tell you. It horrible. After some time they stop the car. Now the priest drive and the other man, he get in back with me. He wash my face with wet cloth, then he do worse things to me. She paused for a moment, holding back the tears. I think this is wedding day, she said. We are in the car back. The priest driving, and looking at us in the mirror, and laughing. He make me his woman... you know?" she told them, through the sobbing."I think we understand," Jenny told her, reaching out to touch her shoulder in an effort to comfort her.Polina regained her composure and continued. "We get to house. It is big place. They take me to bedroom and he make me his woman again. When he finish, the priest take me too. They leave me there. Tell me to wash. I get clean and later he bring me food, then do again."He make me clean and cook for him, and at night he take me as his wife. Most days in daytime too. Many times.""So that was your life?" Harriet asked, sympathetically."Oh no!" Polina laughed. "This is only start. Many weeks are like this. Then one day he bring friend with him. The friend nod to him and give him something, then my husband say I have to do what the man want. This new man take me to bedroom and he take me.""Oh my God," Harriet said under her breath, but she was hiding a smile.Polina looked at her and nodded. "This happen many times, she told them. Many different men he bring. Every week. Some week two times. They pay him, then they... you know. He tell them to use rubber thing, you know? But some, they do not use it."The looks on their faces as Jenny and Harriet exchanged glances, spoke volumes, but Polina continued her account unabated."My husband does not come to me much after. If he want do sex with me, he take me to doctorfor checkup first," she said, using her fingers to indicate 'quote' signs. "Ha! Doctor have his fun too!" she almost spat."No!" Jenny exclaimed in disbelief."Yes!" she retorted, using the English word for the first time, and looking deadly serious and angry."But where do the women come into the picture?" Harriet asked, seemingly impatient for a more sordid twist to the story."I get to this," Polina replied. "Anyways, this happen for long time. More than one year. Sometimes there are two men. They like take me together. One here, one here." She touched her groin, then her behind."Then, this one time, he bring a lady and man. Still I am only sixteen. The men sit to watch the lady with me. She does many thing... dirty thing... give them show. Then all go to bedroom. The man take me and my husband take other lady."After this time, many couple visit. Always the men watch lady with me. Then the man take me, and my husband go with the lady. Some time there can be two, maybe three woman. My husband always take one woman, and the others... they have their fun with me.""This is incredible," Jenny told her, looking appalled, but Harriet was clearly getting heavily turned on, and Polina could see it in her eyes."You think it good to be used like this? Piece of meat, for sex?"Polina challenged her, reading the excitement on her face."No! No, of course not," Harriet denied, but they could both tell it was a lie.After a few seconds of glaring at Harriet, Polina continued. "Later, after I am sixteen years, I am with child. Still they use me, until the men not want me no more. But the ladies, they still come. That make me happier. The ladies, they are gentle. They want make me feel good too. Not just for themself. Then I start to like the ladies. I am happy to be with them. I have my baby, but the ladies, most of them, they comfort me and help me, and... you know?""I understand," Jenny told her, with a smile."Soon the men, they come back and it all start again. It like this for some years... six years," she added, confirming her thoughts, "but my husband, he make sure the men use rubber thing now. Many not like to do this. They not come back."After my baby start to grow, six years maybe, my husband start to play with her. He want to use her for his fun, but I not let him. I tell him I do anything he want, but he leave my girl alone. So he bring new girl, African I think?"She dirty, smelly. Just have rag for clothes. He say wash her. I take outside, burn the clothes. Full with..." she made a gesture with her hand, like a crawly insect."Lice?" Harriet asked, horrified."Da! Lices," she affirmed. "I take and wash her. Have to take away all body hair," she said, indicating the underarms and groin. "Get all lices. She was afraid, but I not hurt her. Just wash. Get all lices gone. Make her clean, smell good."After two days, we know she is clean now. No more lices. I give her new dress. We have big room in house with lots of new clothes," she explained. "Make her pretty... Sexy, you know? For him."The two women nodded."When she look pretty we go to him. He make me teach her. Show her what he want. This girl, she ask me, 'What will he do?' What can I tell her? I just say, 'Close eyes. Not think about it. It will finish soon. Just think of tomorrow'."She have little voice... like this." She made a high pitched, squeaky sound to demonstrate. "He like this sound. Then he send me away. I listen outside. Hear her cry. I want to help her but I know he will beat me, so I must go. Leave her with him. I think, 'he is only one man'. When I start here there are two. Many more come after. Not so bad for her. She be OK," she shrugged."Next day she smiling. She is OK. She like to be with him.""After many days, two more girls come, from China, or Korea. Japan maybe? They both pretty. Not my language so I can not talk to them. He not care. He not want them for talking. He just want... she paused, slapping her left hand on her right bicep as she thrust her right fist upward.Jenny and Harriet just looked at one another."I show all girls what he want. You know?"Jenny nodded, straight faced, but Harriet smiled, clearly excited."One China girl, she very pretty. He hide her when other men come. He make us stand in line for men to choose. Not many choose me now I am older. Men want other girls."She seemed resentful."You weren't jealous of them, were you?" Jenny asked. She looked puzzled. "Did you want the men to choose you too?" she asked."No! No!" she objected. "Not want men. Just..." she paused. "Not want for men to hurt girls," she insisted, but they could tell she was lying."We have four rooms in house with bed. One for him and his girl. Big room for him. Three more smaller, for girls. One each you know? But soon more girls come, so then we must share.""That didn't worry you though, did it," Jenny asked.Polina ignored the question. "Soon we are seven girls in his house, six more and me. Always at night he take new girl for his bed. We hear her cry. Other noise too.""I think we understand," Jenny told her, glancing toward Harriet, who was clearly becoming very turned on by Polina's account."When we have to share, two girls in bed, and there is noise from his room all night, you know, crying, like... you know." She gestured with her arm again."Noise from his room make me feel..." she wriggled around and crossed her legs, "you know?" She paused."We cuddle to get sleep, but... noise make me... Err..." she was mentally searching for a word again."Horny?" Jenny suggested."Da. Horny. I not touch any girl who not want... but I know, they want. Other girls, they do this also.""I can just imagine," Harriet said under her breath, smiling lustily."Many men come too. Some days two, three, four men. Girls have to stand in line. We have to..." she paused, thinking. "We dress up... Err..." she pushed up her bosom, searching for the right word. "For the men, she explained.""Provocatively?" Jenny suggested.Polina looked puzzled."Slutty?" Harriet offered."What is this 'Slutty'?""Alluring," Jenny explained.Polina still looked confused."Sexy," Jenny added."Da! Allurey," Polina blurted.Harriet sniggered.Polina glared, then continued. "We stand in line and men choose. You know."Jenny and Harriet nodded."Then, one day, police come. They take us all away. We find out no-one of us married. There is no book to sign, no... what you say...""Register?" Jenny suggested."Da! No register. We are not his wife. None of us. He just buy us... for sex. Then he sell us again... many times.""I think we guessed that," Jenny told her, offering a comforting hand on her shoulder.There was a long pause. "My new husband, he is good man," she told them, with a weepy smile. "He take me with my daughter. She is eight then. He look after us. He try to satisfy me, but..." she stopped talking."But, you still like girls?" Jenny suggested."Da," she admitted. "I like girls... Very much like girls," she said softly. "But not touch no-one. Not here," she stressed."You poor thing," Jenny said, her voice soft and comforting. She moved the hand from her shoulder, sliding it around Polina's neck as she moved in close. The Romanian woman raised her hand to touch Jenny's forearm in response, resting her cheek on the comforting arm."I had no idea what life could have been like for you," Jenny told her."No one know," Polina agreed."Well, you have nothing to worry about now," Jenny said, stroking her head gently. "We will look after you... properly," she added, smiling."We?" Polina queried.Jenny nodded toward a smiling, lustful Harriet Stacey.She placed a finger under the rugged features of Polina's chin, turning the face up to meet her own. Their lips touched gently as Jenny's other arm slipped around her waist, and she pulled the woman close, and they kissed, seemingly oblivious of their lusty spectator.Jenny's hand slid up to grip Polina's breast, and their bodies pressed together, exciting Harriet Stacey way beyond mere curiosity. Jenny glanced toward the gym teacher and winked. That was her cue. She moved in behind the Romanian and slid her hands around the slender waist from behind, her fingers carefully exploring the lithe shape, but Polina wasn't quite ready yet. She flinched, pulling away in surprise.
"What's wrong?" Jenny asked."Nothing," Polina replied, sounding nervous, "but I must work. I have to clean school.""Do it later," Harriet told her, pressing her cheek against the side of the woman's head from behind."I must do now," Polina objected."Do it tomorrow," Jenny purred, her voice warm and inviting."I get into trouble," she whined, half heartedly."You're already in trouble," Jenny giggled. "You have an itch, and I'd like to scratch it for you," she said, smiling lasciviously.Polina looked worried. No, that wasn't quite it. It was more that she was torn between running and giving in."Don't fret my love," Jenny told her, soothingly. "You know you're going to enjoy it."The woman looked at her, apparently struggling to think of some legitimate, believable means to escape the inevitable."I like your hair," Polina blurted at last, clumsily changing the subject. "You have horse's ass," she said, laughing nervously."What?" Jenny retorted, pulling away and looking horrified, almost angry."Horse ass. Like me," Polina explained, flicking her hair and looking surprised at Jenny's volatile reaction."Ha!" Harriet laughed, "She means your pony tail," the teacher explained, sniggering. "Her English is so poor.""Oh," Jenny replied, with a laugh. "Yes. I have a horse's ass," she smiled, moving back a little closer."And... who was it who told you, that this..." she said as she flicked Polina's hair, "is called a horse's ass?""Some girls. How you are saying... grupa?""A group?" Jenny offered."Da. A group.""Do you know who they were?" Jenny enquired, at the same time that Harriet asked her. "How many?""Da. I know them." She held up her outstretched hand, saying, "Five, maybe six?""And they all hang around together?""Da. All together. Two gold hair girls are leaders. They call me Horse's Ass," Polina revealed, looking slightly worried. "This is bad?""Hmmm. I have am idea who these girls might be. I also think someone is playing a nasty trick on you," Jenny told her."Oh," the woman replied, looking embarrassed. "I am thinking Horse Ass is not good name?""It's really called a Pony Tail," Jenny told her, smiling. "No matter, You know now... and we can always get our own back.""What is this Get own back?"Jenny smiled. "It means, my dear," she said kindly, stroking Polina's cheek, "that we can play a trick on them too. You know? Pay back?""Oh. Da," Polina smiled. "Pay back," nodding to confirm her understanding."So... you are the janitor.""Da," Polina nodded, looking happier."And, you like what you do here?""Da. Is good to work here.""But you must find it difficult, don't you?" Jenny asked."No," Polina laughed. "This easy. Not hard work for me.""That wasn't quite what I meant," Jenny told her."No?" Polina replied, looking puzzled."No," Jenny smiled, shaking her head. "I meant, you must find it difficult with all these young girls around. Because you like girls, don't you.""No. I not do this thing here," she objected, beginning to look a little nervous. "I work here.""You know you want them though. So many pretty young things. It must be very..." Jenny traced a fingertip from Polina's shoulder, down her arm, adding the words, "distracting for you. No?""I know what you say," Polina replied, "but I not do this," she insisted, backing away toward the door."Maybe... but you want to, don't you," Jenny insisted. "You like girls, don't you?" she asked. "You said you like girls. Most men like girls. Boys like girls.""I know this, but I am not man, or boy," she replied defensively."I don't understand," Jenny told her, looking puzzled. "Why would you bother to tell us such a detailed story of your early life, and your obvious love for other girls, only to deny your lust for them? Why resist following a similar course when a clear opportunity arises?"Polina had no answer."You might be surprised to learn just how many girls like like to have fun with other girls," Jenny went on, "and many women like to play with young girls too." Polina looked worried. "Harriet and I both like girls," Jenny told her, turning toward Stacey, "don't we!" she affirmed, "and we know you like girls too," she added, purring the words lustfully.Polina shook her head in pointless denial."Just think about all those pretty young ladies. Such lovely faces," she teased, "and sweet, tender young bodies. So fresh and innocent. Some not so innocent," she smirked. "All those beautiful, nubile young girls. It must be very tempting for you. Isn't that why you came in here today? Weren't you hoping to catch Harriet with one of those pretty young things?""I not know what you mean," Polina objected, clearly horrified at being caught out."It's Ok," Jenny reassured her. "We know how tempting they are. We both like young girls too, she said. Maybe we can help you.""I can not do this thing," Polina protested, shaking her head. "They will give a sack to me.""She means she'll get the sack," Harriet translated.Jenny turned to face Harriet and smiled. "I got that," she said, nodding, then turning back to Polina. "You don't need to worry about that. No one is going to find out. If they did, she would lose her job too..." Jenny told her, nodding toward the teacher, "along with any hope of getting another," Jenny explained. "No one will find out. We'll make sure of that."Polina looked back and forth between the two of them, considering the tempting possibilities."Wouldn't you like to have some fun with one of those pretty young things?" Harriet asked, smiling suggestively."Stop this. Please. You get me all wet," she smiled, wriggling around in her shorts."I know you want them," Jenny told her. "Show me," she demanded."Show what?" Polina asked."Show me the wet," Jenny smirked.The brunette shook her head. "Someone can see," she objected."No," Harriet countered. "There's no-one here. You said so yourself."Jenny stepped toward her and slipped her arms around the slim waist, reaching for the cords tying the tabard. She pulled on one cord and it fell open."Let's get rid of this, shall we?" she said softly as she lifted the tabard up and over Polina's head.There was that familiar, faint whiff of body odour again as the brunette raised her arms. "Hmmm... A bit sweaty?" Jenny commented."Not fair," Polina whined. "I am working all day," she explained, with a frown."No need to worry," Jenny assured her. "I quite like it." She smiled, glancing down. And these are nice, she complemented, teasing the stiff nipples that were distorting the shape of Polina's otherwise snug fitting tee-shirt."Oh," the woman squealed slightly, looking embarrassed."Come now," Jenny told her. "Surely you're not shy? Not with us," she teased.The pair took Polina's hands and pulled the reticent woman into the office with them, closing the door behind them and pushing her up against the wall on the inside."No. Please. I can not do this. I have to work," Polina objected, turning away and reaching for the handle, but Jenny pushed her hand up against the door to stop the woman from retreating."I don't think you really want to go, do you?" she asked."No. Stop this," Polina continued to resist, feebly, shaking her head. "I must not be like this.""Who's to know?" Jenny persisted. "Come on Harriet. Help me with this."Between the pair of them they began to strip her."What you are doing?" Polina objected."We're going to give you a wash my love," Jenny told her, smiling."No," she complained. "I must do my work.""Do it tomorrow," Jenny told her."No. I must not," came a languid, whining objection."You know you want to," Jenny told her."No-one will ever know," Harriet coaxed."Come on baby. You want this," Jenny insisted.A few moments later, Jenny had pulled the tee-shirt up over Polina's head, tossing it to the floor. Harriet fell to her knees, gripping the hem of the shorts and pulling them down to the Romanian woman's ankles with her. A skilled hand reaching behind Polina's back, released the simple catch on her flimsy bra, which pinged forward releasing a pair of firm, ripe breasts, sporting beautifully stiff, dark nipples, as Harriet pressed her cheek to Polina's thigh, inhaling the rich, pungent vaginal aroma."My God, I can hardly wait," the teacher moaned as she kissed the silky soft skin, high on the thigh, just below the damp patch in the gusset of Polina's panties."Please. I must not do this," Polina continued to resist feebly, as Jenny pulled the near naked woman away from her kneeling accomplice and led her toward the shower.She quickly unfastened the front of her summer dress, letting it slip from her shoulders and catching it deftly with one hand as she stepped out. She tossed it aside to fall in an untidy heap on a nearby bench, and as they stood facing each other, Jenny reached out with both hands to grip Polina's waist, sliding them upward until she could cup the firm, perfectly shaped breasts of the semi-reluctant woman, squeezing and kneading them as Polina closed her eyes in tormented pleasure."Come, my love," Jenny said softly, leading Polina by the hand to enter the shower room, closely followed by a highly excited looking Harriet Stacey."Where are you going?" Jenny asked."With you two?" Harriet replied, in a surprised and slightly disappointed, questioning tone."With your clothes on?" Jenny smirked."Oh. Yes. OK," she conceded, waiting behind to hurriedly remove her track suit and underwear.By the time Harriet joined them, less than a minute later, Jenny was already up close and getting extremely personal with Polina, who was clad in only a flimsy pair of flesh coloured lace panties. Harriet, on the other hand, was totally naked, her less than pert breasts sagging a little, a sign of her advancing age, and probably a good deal of ill-treatment from self-administered lust over a number of years. The rest of her body, on the other hand, was in reasonable shape, a product of her chosen career, no doubt. Her only other less than attractive feature, was a thick bush of black curly muff, that would have been extremely difficult to avoid creeping from the sides of even the most unflattering of grannie knickers.Polina too was completely nude, her underwear lying discarded on the floor to one side. Her body was extremely trim looking, given her age, and the thicket of pubic fur that adorned her groin was similarly dark, but far less unkempt than the teacher who was currently admiring her.At that particular moment Polina appeared somewhat subdued, as if perhaps in some entranced state, in stark contrast to her rather more animated behaviour from just a few minutes earlier. Harriet puzzled for a moment, finally shrugging off the idea, and putting it down to the woman's total submission of her sylph like frame to the intensity of Jenny's dominant libido.Their mouths were locked in a passionate kiss, with Jenny's right hand pressed tightly up between Polina's parted thighs, moving slowly and deliberately, as the brunette moaned in passive abandon. They hadn't even bothered to turn the shower on, completely overlooking Jenny's original ruse of giving the lady janitor a thorough ablution.The teacher admired Jenny's statuesque form. She was still surprisingly shapely for a woman of her age, with very little cellulite or body fat, and her unfettered breasts were still firm and rounded."My God Jenny. How do you do this?" Harriet asked in amazement."Oh, didn't I tell you?" Jenny replied, looking up and smiling, "I can be very persuasive when I want to."Polina opened her eyes slightly, looked toward Harriet Stacey, and smiled, then closing her eyes again she let her head fall back, relaxing in the arms of her new-found lover."Remember what I told you," Jenny said to her nude partner. It sounded like some sort of warning, but it came with a smile and a kindly tone.As Polina began to whimper softly, her hips began to gyrate in sympathy with the slow, regular motion of Jenny's hand, the English woman's kisses progressing downward, until she could reach her tormented partner's shapely breasts. She proceeded to lick all around the firm, mammary flesh, occasionally gripping one stiff nipple between her lips and tugging gently, as her middle two fingers probed the woman deeply.Before long, Polina was moaning like some rampant whore. "Ooohh. Oh no. I cannot do this. You make me feel like naughty little schoolgirl," she cried, then gasped."I think we'd all like one of those," Jenny laughed, "but we'll have to settle for each other for now.""Oh. You are very wicked lady," the naked Romanian giggled."My turn," Harriet told her, moving in for her first kiss.As she slipped her hands around Polina's waist, she craned her neck, reaching up to kiss the taller woman. Polina accepted willingly, and Harriet reached up to squeeze one firm breast as they lost themselves in a wave of passion.For a few moments Polina's new partners exchanged kisses with her and each other, and while one was kissing the Romanian, the other was bending low to suck on her nipples. Very soon she was crying out, close to orgasm."Quiet baby," Jenny soothed."Don't worry," Harriet countered. "There's no-one around to hear," she laughed.The pitch of Polina's cries increased until Harriet was sure she would come, but suddenly she stopped grinding her hips and began to pant."What's wrong?" Harriet asked."I stopped her," Jenny replied with a wicked smile.At that very moment, Polina began to move her hips again, aching to resume her pleasure, but it was in vain. Jenny wouldn't let her continue."Please," she moaned, still gasping and panting."OK baby." Just a little more, Jenny relented.Soon she was grinding away again, and for almost a minute she enjoyed the sensation of the two women's kisses, both sucking on her engorged nipples, and Jenny's two middle fingers probing her so expertly. Until, that is, once more she came close to orgasm, and again Jenny stopped."Oh no! Please," Polina cried. "Do not stop. Let me finish," she begged.Jenny laughed. "No baby. I'm going to keep you going for as long as I can. We're going to give you the best time you've ever had."She looked at Harriet, who was also obviously excited by the situation. "Go down on her," Jenny ordered.Harriet hesitated, looking at Jenny. nervously. "I've never done anything like this before," she admitted."No!" Jenny exclaimed in disbelief. "You're joking, surely. You must have!""No. Never," she repeated. "I wanted to, of course, but I've never had the nerve.""But, the stories I heard about you with the girls from the senior form. What about Suzanne Baker? My daughter told me about you with her.""Just stories," Harriet revealed. "Some girls have a tendency to exaggerate, she explained. "Yes, I like to pet them. Kiss them. Maybe play with them a little," she revealed, "but I never did anything like this. Not with any of the girls. I was always too afraid of what might happen if we got caught.""Hmmm," Jenny mused. "Much the same as if you'd been caught not taking them all the way, I shouldn't wonder," she told the woman. "You're a teacher, after all. Yours is a position of responsibility and trust. The authorities would crucify you if they found out."Harriet sighed. "I was stupid, wasn't I," she said."A little I suppose, but no matter. All that is behind you now. We're going to have some proper fun from now on," Jenny smiled encouragingly. "You just wait and see."Harriet nodded, smiling nervously as she fell to her knees once more, this time in front of the naked Polina.The woman looked down and smiled, parting her knees wider as Harriet pulled Jenny's hand away, raising her open mouth to the moist thicket of dark bush between Polina's thighs."Clean my hand for me," Jenny ordered.Harriet looked perplexed, but she obeyed, just for a few moments, until courage prevailed and she discarded the hand, pushing it aside and extending her tongue to test the flavour of Polina's sopping wet slit. The Romanian moaned and leaned back, parting her thighs wide to allow the gym teacher access to her open crotch. As she did so, Harriet gazed up to see her prone new lover and Jenny, sharing a passionate kiss, with Jenny's hand squeezing and kneading one firm breast, and Polina's hand now reaching inside Jenny's panties."That's right my love," Jenny whispered. "Do that for me.""Oh!" Polina exclaimed in surprise. "You have no hair here?""Of course not," Jenny replied, smiling. "Lady parts taste so much sweeter when the skin is bare," she added. "Wouldn't you agree Harriet?" she asked."I wouldn't know," the gym teacher replied, raising her head for a moment, "but I can imagine," she added. "Beautiful smooth, sexy bare skin," she laughed, before dipping her head down again to thrust her open mouth against the wet fur that was Polina's crotch."Oh my," she murmured. "This is so much softer than mine."She began lapping and slurping greedily, plunging her tongue as deep as she could reach, delighting in the sounds that their mutual partner was making.Jenny smiled and gave Harriet a few moments, then stopped her. "Let's have that shower, shall we?" she suggested."Good idea," the teacher agreed, standing to reach for the tap."Hey!" Jenny squealed. "Just a minute. I still have my panties on," she laughed, wriggling out of them. "Can't go home with wet panties, can I," she reasoned."Why not?" Polina countered, with a wry smile. "I will have to."They both looked at her, puzzled at first, then laughed, realising what she meant.There was a metallic squeak from the tap and Polina let out a squeal of surprise as the initial cold of the spray wetted her naked body, making her nipples stand proud. Harriet lowered her head into the warming spray, closing her lips over one stiff nipple as she slipped her arms around the passive woman's waist, as Polina turned her head toward Jenny to accept another long, deep kiss.The willing thighs parted again as Harriet's hand slipped down over one hip, and around the front to slide down over the wetted bush of Polina's pubic muff. She slipped a finger into the woman, now lapping and sucking on one ripe breast as Polina pushed her groin forward to eagerly accept the probing."Another," Polina cried."Another what?" the confused teacher cried."Fingers," Polina gasped. "More fingers."Harriet inserted a second finger, prompting Polina to whisper, "Oh yes. Fuck me," to them. "Both of you, fuck me.""Don't you think we'd better wash you first?" Jenny laughed.Harriet removed her fingers and was about to reach for the soap when Polina stopped her, gripping her wrist and raising the teacher's hand to her own mouth."Mmmm," she murmured, drawing Harriet's two middle fingers into her mouth to suck them clean as she smiled at the gym teacher. "I love the taste of cunt," she whispered. "I am hoping you taste this good," she smiled. "Now... you can wash me," she breathed.Harriet smiled and began to lather Polina's neat pubic muff as Jenny took the soap from her and attended to the rear."Oh no! Oh please!" Polina cried softly, in an obviously fake objection, while making no attempt to escape their intimate lavation of her most personal parts. Every now and then, she would turn her head to accept a kiss from one or the other of them, allowing their fingers to explore her more intimately.
"Here," Jenny said to Harriet, nodding toward Polina's firm breasts. She began to lap at one while Harriet did likewise with the other, both women happy that Polina's arms enfolded them as she enjoyed their advances."Oh my! What you are doing to me?" the Romanian asked rhetorically, as she wriggled around."We're giving you a double my love," Jenny told her. "You've had a double before, haven't you?""Not with the fingers," she replied, laughing as she gasped and writhed between them."Well, get used to it baby. This is only the start," Jenny laughed, inserting a second digit into her rear."Should I use some soap in here?" Harriet asked."Of course, but be sure to rinse it thoroughly... unless you like the taste," Jenny giggled.They took turns probing her, front and rear as they caressed her naked body, suckling on her engorged nipples, as Polina just stood there, allowing them the most depraved intimacy, and thoroughly enjoying every second."This will have to go," Jenny told her at last, stroking the wetness of Polina's thick dark muff. "Should we do it for you?""No. I can do this," Polina replied smiling."OK, but make sure it's gone by the next time we see you.""When is this?" she asked, expectantly."Well, I'll be back here again on Thursday," Jenny told her, with an inviting smile, "but I should think Harriet might appreciate a visit from you tomorrow," she added, with a suggestive wink to the gym teacher."I am thinking that might be good for me also," Polina agreed, smiling at the other woman."And... if you come back on Thursday..." Jenny went on, "I might be able to arrange for a very cute little lady for you to play with," she smiled. "Very sweet. Very young looking.""Not my Wendy?" Harriet objected firmly.Jenny turned and glared at her.The teacher shook her head, looking concerned. "Not my Wendy? she repeated, but this time her tone sounded more like a plea."What makes you think she's your Wendy?" Jenny challenged."Well... I, err...""You err what?" Jenny mocked, with an air of superiority."I found her," Harriet reasoned."And I tamed her," Jenny smiled."But...""No Harriet," Jenny interrupted, her voice soft and soothing. "Not Wendy," she relented. "I was thinking of Angela's little friend Macey, for Polina." she smiled. "I have something far more..." she paused, as if in thought, "more interesting... in mind for sweet little Wendy," she added."I thought we were going to share her," Harriet whined, in a disappointed tone.Jenny shook her head. "You can have your fun with pretty little Wendy..." she told the woman, "when I'm done with her. She won't be your little Wendy until I give her to you," Jenny announced. "But know this. When I do give her to you, you will be able to do anything you want with her. And I really do mean, anything. Trust me, she will let you have whatever sordid fun you like. She will give herself completely. But, for now, you'll have to wait.""But... What about our deal? Until then, I mean.""Our deal?" Jenny questioned, giving her a pathetic look. "Look! There are two senior forms in this school," she reminded the teacher. "That's over forty girls, isn't it? Don't worry. You won't be lonely," she smirked. "Next time you have those girls for a gym session, just look at them. Look carefully at each and every one of them, and know that very soon you'll be able to taste their sweet young pussies. Just imagine their cries of pleasure as we fuck our way through the entire senior year."Harriet smiled, then her expression changed. "But... What about Thursday?" she continued. "I was really looking forward to some fun with Wendy on Thursday.""I'll have a word with my Angela. You do like Angela, don't you?""Yes, of course, but...""I'm sure my Angela can come up with something to please you," Jenny interrupted, with a smile."How can I be sure that..." Harriet began, but Jenny interrupted her again."My Angela will do anything I ask of her. Don't worry. She is very experienced in these matters," Jenny smiled, "and I'm sure you could do with the practice," she smirked."That wasn't what we agreed" Harriet complained, with a whine."We didn't actually agree anything," Jenny reminded her, with an enigmatic smile, "but Angela has such a perfect young body, as I'm sure you are well aware.""What do you mean?" Harriet retorted, clearly embarrassed by the suggestion.Jenny smiled. "You watch them in the showers, don't you?" she asked."Well... errr...""Of course you do," Jenny grinned. "And why wouldn't you. You want them, after all, don't you?" Jenny smiled. "And she has the most beautiful, tender shaven pussy... So soft... so juicy... and she tastes so rich and sweet," she told the woman, teasing her. "Rest assured, Angela will give you everything you ever wanted, and more."The teacher looked back and forth between her two companions. "But as for that awful muff you both have on you," Jenny added, "just be sure it's all gone by Thursday."Harriet looked forlorn, but Polina smiled. "I will do this for you," she nodded. "We can do for each other, she suggested," turning to the teacher and smiling broadly."OK. We're agreed then. Now, would you like to try this one?" Jenny suggested, parting her thighs to reveal her clean shaven mound.Polina just smiled, unceremoniously pushing Harriet aside as she crouched down, pressing her cheek to the bare, shaven flesh at the top of Jenny's thigh, then raising her face to the waiting crotch."Mmmm..." the Romanian purred. "You smell divine," she said softly, pressing her lips to the soft wetness of Jenny mound.She kissed it, then licked gently, carefully, before extending her tongue to reach beneath Jenny's groin and lapping at the moist slit."Oh Jennifer," she sighed. "You taste very good.""You should call me Jenny," she replied. "Especially while you're sucking my cunt," she laughed."Sorry," the woman apologised, gasping as she came up for air."Oh my goodness. Is that all you?" Jenny asked in surprise, unsure about how the Romanian woman could reach almost to her anus from the front."Da," Polina laughed. "Is all me.""Have some more?" Jenny encouraged."Of course," her new lover laughed."Oh! Oh! Oh my God," Jenny cried out as Polina slipped her tongue into the slit. "Oh my God!" she cried."What?" Harriet asked."Oh my God Harriet. You should let her do this for you. Oh my God. This is amazing.""What? Tell me," Harriet begged."Oh, I couldn't possibly tell you," Jenny laughed between gasps of pleasure. "You're going to have to find out for yourself. Oh my God. Do it again. Oh God. Oh yes. Deeper, deeper," she cried.This went on for several minutes, until finally Jenny let out a cry of intense pleasure as her body began to shake and jerk."Oh, Polina," she said softly as she calmed down. "Polina baby. I think I love you," she laughed.Polina laughed, smiling seductively. "I like to do this," she said."What?" Harriet repeated, quite insistently this time.Polina looked up and smiled at her. "I give you tomorrow," she said, before turning back to Jenny's sweet, shaven slit, licking gently with the tip of her fully extended tongue - all four inches of it."Oh my God. Now I understand," Harriet grinned. "Come on. It's my turn.""Tomorrow," Polina repeated, looking far too coy and reserved for what she had just been doing. "Now I must go," she smiled, "but first..."She turned and moved closer to kiss Harriet gently on the lips, as the poor woman promptly melted in her arms.Breaking from the kiss moments later, the gym teacher gazed at her and asked, "Do you have any idea how long I have wanted to do something like this?""Maybe as long as I wanted also?" Polina replied. They both laughed, resuming their kiss with renewed passion, until Jenny interrupted them."OK. Come on you two. Break it up," she laughed."My God. I can hardly wait for tomorrow," Harriet breathed."Well, wait you must," Jenny told her, "but..." she added, turning to the slender Romanian, "while I think of it, my daughter Geraldine will be eighteen in a few weeks," she said to Polina. "We'll be having a couple of her friends from school over for a little party. Why don't you bring your daughter Alysia to visit afterwards? I'm sure she and Angela would like to..." she paused, adding the words, "catch up," in a suggestive sounding, loud whisper.Polina smiled and licked her lips, raising her eyebrows excitedly. "That will be nice I am thinking," she replied.Jenny turned to Harriet. "You know," she began, "between the three of us, ladies, sooner or later, we're going to taste every sweet little pussy in this school..." she paused, "and it all starts on Thursday, with my beautiful daughter Angela," she said, looking at Harriet, "her cute little friend Macey," she added, turning to Polina, "and that exquisite little virgin Wendy, who I can't wait to get my hands on," she told them, squeezing one of her own breasts and closing her eyes as she gripped her groin."Surely you're not suggesting we take advantage of the juniors?" Harriet questioned her, noticing the excited expression on Polina's face."Of course not," Jenny assured her, giving them both a knowing look, "but they will all reach the senior year at some time," she smiled, "and when they do..."She stopped mid-sentence, placing her hands together in front of her face, in a sort of praying pose, then opened her hands while keeping the wrists together, like a flower opening, bowing her head into the open palms as she began to lick erotically all around the point where her wrists met."Oh," Polina nodded, with an excited smile."But for now Polina, my love, you had better go.""OK. I go now," the slender Romanian smiled, reaching for a towel from the rack. She dried herself quickly and gathered her clothes, reaching out for the hands of the two women and stepping backwards slowly, holding their hands for as long as she could, allowing their fingers to slip from hers while backing away.Finally, she turned and departed the shower room, leaving Jenny and Harriet to turn off the spray behind her.The moment Polina was out of sight, the two women turned to face one another, reaching for their own towels, and they began drying each other, laughing and playing together. But, within minutes, the smile had fallen from Jenny's face as she turned toward her naked partner with a serious expression."We need each other, you and I," she told the woman, solemnly."I know," Harriet smiled, lustfully."I'm being serious," Jenny insisted."Oh," Harriet apologised. "How so?" she asked."My youngest daughter Geraldine will be eighteen in a couple of weeks," Jenny explained. "She will be leaving her school then. Angela will be leaving here in a month or so too, as soon as she has finished her diploma. After that, my supply of fresh young pussy will come to an end," she said, sadly."So? How can I help?" Harriet asked."You already know the answer to that," Jenny smiled. "After that, I will need you to keep me supplied with pretty young ladies to... satisfy my appetite, and you will need me to convince them to submit their delectable young bodies to us both," she smiled.Harriet nodded her agreement, and continued to wipe the quickly vanishing moisture from her new accomplice."One thing I don't understand about her story though," Harriet said, gesturing toward the door."Polina?" Jenny queried."Uh Huh," she nodded."Just the one?" Jenny asked, with a wry smile."OK. One in particular," she conceded."Which is?""She was there against her will, right?""So she says," Jenny affirmed."And she said she wasn't jealous of the other girls, yet clearly she was.""Seems that way. So?""So, why would she be jealous? Surely if her faux husband and the other customers were leaving her alone, surely she would be grateful?""Hmmm. It's a puzzle isn't it. But I've heard of kidnap victims, and essentially that's what she was... they can develop a bond with their captors, especially when they have been persistently raped or sexually abused.""Agreed," Harriet conceded, "but what about the other girls? Why would she be jealous of them, when the men didn't choose her?""I don't know. Perhaps she had learned to like getting fucked. That wouldn't surprise me. Or maybe it was just a pride thing? We'll have to ask her.""Huh! I don't think so," Harriet smirked. "Anyway, there's something else that's been bothering me.""Oh?" Jenny replied."Nothing to do with Polina. Not really anyway. It's just that... I'm a bit worried about you two coming here on a regular basis, to meet girls.""Oh?" Jenny queried, rubbing the woman down more erotically. "I thought you said that there was no-one around in the evenings.""There isn't. Not usually anyway," Harriet agreed. "But, sometimes Mrs Dale, the Headmistress, she stays late in her office. She's there tonight I think. Her car was still here when I looked out earlier.""Oh. I see," Jenny smiled. "And you think she might come over here and want her share too?" Jenny joked."It's no laughing matter," Harriet told her. "If she caught us here I'd get the sack.""Worse, I'd imagine," Jenny smirked."Well, that means we can't use this place to meet, can we," she objected."Yes we can," Jenny assured her, giving her a peck of a kiss. "You leave Mrs Dale to me. I'll pay her a visit tomorrow evening.""How will that help?" Harriet asked."Oh," Jenny smirked, "did I forget to mention. I can be very persuasive if I need to be."..........................That evening, as with most Tuesdays and Thursdays, Angie and I were at my house for tea, and after we had eaten we went upstairs for our usual rounding off of the meal with a quick shave and sixty-nine for dessert.After a while, my mam came up and knocked my bedroom door, just as we were winding up. There was a hurried scuffle and pulling up of panties followed far too quickly by my mam opening the door.The look on her face said it all. What she wanted we never found out. It was inconsequential anyway. She just stopped in her tracks and said, "Oh. Perhaps I'll wait until you come down." Then she turned away, closed the door and left us.As she did so, we too stopped in embarrassment, but it was too late. The damage was done."Do you think she saw us?" Angie asked."Of course she saw us," I snapped."Maybe she won't say anything," she suggested. I just gave her one of my pathetic looks, cocking my head to one side.When we came down, mam was stony faced. "I'm tewibly sowy," Angie told her. "I don't know what came over me," she lied, in a vain effort to get me off the hook. But it failed of course, probably just making the situation worse.Surprisingly, though, my mam was unexpectedly calm. "Look girls," she said. "You're both over eighteen, so I guess you can do what you want. I suppose I'd rather you were doing that than something similar with boys." She sighed, heavily. "Even so," she went on. "I think I'd rather you didn't do it under my roof."I was about to speak when she added, "And for Lord's sake, don't let your father catch you doing that sort of thing. Heaven knows he finds it difficult enough to keep his hands off Angela whenever you bring her here. I dread to think what would happen if he were to witness that sort of stimulation."We were both dumbfounded."Off with you now," she said to Angie, before we could reply, "and no goodbye kisses on the doorstep tonight."We were mortified. Just thinking she already knew about that, horrified us.She looked back and smiled. "Did ya' think I didn't know?"Of course she did, but thinking back, we were grateful that it wasn't my step-dad that caught us. If it had been him there's no telling what might have happened. He would probably have raped the pair of us. I've always known that men get turned on by girls getting it on together.As I'm sure I've mentioned before, I wouldn't trust him to be alone with me, let alone Angie. I always had visions of him hanging around in the street when it was time for her to leave, or following her, getting to know her route home, then parking his van at some quiet point along the route, preparing to grab her one night, stuffing her into the back and raping her. There were a few very remote, deserted areas along the route that I knew she couldn't avoid. It wouldn't take him long to work that out too.I tried to put the thought out of my head. It was making me wet. I could picture her in the back of his van, with him towering over her, ripping the clothes from her body while she cried, struggling to fight him off. Many men will try to tell you that most girls fantasize about being raped. I don't know if that is true, but the idea of a big strong man having his evil way with me, gets my pulse racing, although the prospect scares me too.Perhaps I would like the idea of watching, if I could be sure he wouldn't really hurt her. The very idea of seeing Angie stripped naked and on her back on a bed of rough hessian sack, with my step-dad pinning her down, legs akimbo, and reaming her while she cried. I wondered if she would like it, the way I felt the idea excited me. She was becoming quite slutty of late, and I felt it might be a sort of poetic justice if I were to let him get to her. She'd probably like a thick, hot cock inside her. I imagined all she might complain about would be the rough sacking chaffing her back and her arse.'Stop it at once' I told myself. This is your girlfriend. Even so, I couldn't help getting wet just thinking about it...............That evening, Angie told me later, they were sitting in the lounge, her and her mum, and Jenny had been giving her odd looks."What?" Angie had finally asked."Angela, darling," Jenny began, hedging delicately around the subject. "I have a little something that I'd like you to do for me.""What is it Mama?" Angie replied.She told Angie that she wanted her to make friends with Wendy. "You know the one," she said. "That cute little brunette from the other senior class.""Hmmm. I wonder why you picked her," Angie replied, with a knowing look to her mother."I didn't pick her my love. She just happened to... fall, into my lap, so to speak," Jenny smirked."Intewesting turn of phwase," Angie sniggered. "If I do this," she asked, sounding more serious, "I can't have Macey getting jealous. You know how I care about her.""You leave Macey to me. Whatever happens, I'll make sure she doesn't get upset about it.""OK. But be sure you do. I mean it!" Angie warned."Here. Take this," Jenny said, giving Angie a small package about nine inches long and about two inches square. "It's a sort of birthday present," Jenny told her daughter. "Maybe you could help her with it?"Angie smiled. "Of course Mama. I'd be happy to. Is it what I think it is?" she asked."Probably not," her mother replied, "But in any case, don't go taking any liberties now. She's a virgin and I want her to stay that way... at least until Friday.""Why? What happens on Fwiday?""She's coming home with you for the weekend, my dear," Jenny revealed."Did she say that?""Not yet, but she will.""Don't you think that might make Macey a bit jealous?" Angie asked. It was more of a stating of the obvious, than a question."Aren't you a bit tired of her yet?" her mother responded.
Angie hesitated. "I'm not," came a voice from the kitchen. Ges' face appeared in the doorway. "Can I have her if you're fed up with her?" Angie's younger sister asked."I'm not fed up with her," Angie insisted, firmly."But, you two have been cooling off just lately, haven't you?" her mam suggested."Maybe... Just a little," Angie admitted, with a sigh."There you are then," Jenny told her. "It would do you both good to have a break.""Ooohh. Goody," Ges squealed, excitedly."Don't go getting any ideas," Angie warned."Anyway, Macey won't be here," Jenny added, before Angie could challenge her sister again."Why not? She always comes to stay with us at the weekend.""I have an idea she may be somewhere else on Friday night, this week," her mam revealed."Huh!" Angie retorted. "When was that decided?" she asked."Tomorrow," Jenny told her, smirking. "Don't worry. We'll be having our fun with pretty little Wendy this weekend. All of us," she told them.So, the next day at school; that was the Wednesday, Angie and I sought out Wendy during the lunch break."Hello," Angie introduced herself with a smile, as we approached. "I'm Angie, and this is my fwiend Macey.""I know who you are," Wendy replied, looking decidedly suspicious."It's alwight," Angie told her with a laugh. "We don't bite.""What do you want?" Wendy asked. It sounded a little rude, but I'm sure she didn't mean it that way. She was just unsure about us.Angie looked at me and smiled, then back to the brunette girl. "I was told it was your birthday," she said. "My Mama gave me a pwesent for you."She held out the wrapped package for Wendy to take."What is it?" Wendy asked, her expression quickly changing to one of excited curiosity."Why don't you open it?" Angie suggested.Wendy took the gift and quickly ripped the paper off to reveal a dark box with a picture of a personal trimmer on the front, and the words Lady Shave Deluxe, in large pink letters."Do you know what it is?" Angie asked.Without looking up, Wendy nodded."Do you know why you've been given it?"She looked back and forth from one to the other of us, then silently nodded again."Would you like me to show you how to use it?" Angie asked her.She shook her head, looking concerned. "No, thank you. I don't think so.""Are you sure?" Angie pressed the girl, eagerly. She looked at me, licking her lips, then back to Wendy, biting her lip. She had a faintly predatory look about her, which worried me more than just a little. "I'd be happy to do it for you," she offered. "wouldn't we?" she added as an afterthought, looking back to me again. "We could go to the toilets and do it for you there."I didn't have much doubt about what would happen if we got her into the relative privacy of the toilets, and I think Wendy realised the same."Do you do it for her?" she asked, nodding toward me."No," I replied, quickly interrupting, before Angie could reply. "I do that myself."Angie glared at me as if to say 'Thanks very much - not.' "I do it for my sister," she countered.I resisted the temptation to add, Everyone does it for your sister."We'd be happy to help you," I suggested, in an effort to make amends with Angie.Wendy looked back and forth between us again. "Thank you," she began, "but I'm sure I'll be able to manage."Angie looked disappointed. "Oh. OK then. If you're sure.""I am, thank you," Wendy told her, smiling sweetly, a slight nervous look in her eye."Just be sure to pull the skin tight," I suggested kindly, with Angie adding, "Don't want to nick yourself, do you." She smiled."OK," Wendy agreed, smiling nervously."Oh, and," Angie turned back to add, "just a suggestion, but... don't wear any deodowant tomowow.""No?" Wendy queried, looking surprised."No! None at all. Not anywhere," Angie affirmed."Why not?" the little brunette asked, looking puzzled. "I don't want to smell all sweaty.""Don't wowy," Angie told her. "No-one will mind. It's just that... well... nobody likes the taste of deodowant," she smiled, staring pointedly at the girl for several seconds, before turning away again."Did you give her the present?" Jenny asked as we arrived at Angie's house after school."Of course," Angie told her."And I suppose you offered to help her with it?""She said she wanted to take it home to try it out," I interrupted, saving Angie the embarrassment of having to lie.Jenny smiled. "Good girls," she said. "I do so want to be first with her.""Is that the new girl you're talking about?" Ges asked. "You said we could all play with her," she complained."And so we can sweetie," Jenny told her youngest, "but that will be at the weekend. I have to meet her tomorrow, to... get her ready.""Oh. OK," Ges smiled, her simple mind satisfied once more.I looked at them in surprise. It would be the first time they had openly involved Ges in any group activities as far as I knew. Ges just grinned. I looked at Angie and she shrugged. 'Oh well' I thought. I supposed there was no real reason why she couldn't be included - as long as we didn't go advertising the fact to all and sundry, that is.The rest of the evening went much the same as usual, except I felt that Ges was paying me rather more attention than normal. She kept looking at me and smiling, and whenever we would all sit together, like when we were watching TV, she would insist on sitting next to me, and pressing herself up against me, and she would keep turning and grinning. It made me feel a little uneasy, but more so because Angie wasn't objecting as much as I felt she ought to. It seemed as if she was happy to let her sister take far too much interest in me.And when it was time for me to leave, Ges went outside as usual, but Angie seemed to take little or no notice. I met Ges outside in the alley, as we had done so many times before, but on this occasion she was so forward that I hardly recognised the shy young girl she had always been until then.I had to admit to myself, it excited me to think that in a few weeks it would be her birthday, and we would be free to do whatever we wanted - with Angie's consent, of course.Thursday seemed to drag, but eventually our gym session came and ended. Unsurprisingly, Angie and I were asked to stay behind, and I couldn't help wondering what wicked treats Jenny had planned for us. It was obvious that she had to be behind this. After all, she had been dropping so many hints the previous evening, you would have had to be brain-dead to have missed them. Added to that, there was the fact that she had given Wendy such an outrageously provocative birthday gift, we knew the little brunette would have to be the star attraction.... To be continued...Once again, thank you for reading my story. I sincerely hope you enjoyed it.In recognition for my effort, please be kind enough to give a score. I really do appreciate it.
