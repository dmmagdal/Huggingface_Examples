Chapter 17 -- The AccidentWednesday, March 2ndI park behind Nicole in front of the Taylor's house. There's a police car in front of hers. I look around but don't see any reason why they're here. Getting out of my car, I walk hesitantly up to the house and knock. An officer answers the door and asks who I am. I tell him my name, and Bob says to let me in.Stepping inside, my eyes are drawn to the Taylors on their couch, with Nicole and Jesse next to them. A second officer is in a chair talking to them. Alarm bells ring in my head because I don't see Christina and wonder where she is. I ask the officer where Christina is and what's going on; he politely asks me to sit down. As I do so, I look at the Taylors more closely. Both of them have tears streaming down their cheeks. Then I focus on Nicole, who is pale, and her eyes are really red. It appears Jesse has been crying, too; her face is full of shock and sadness.I'm worried now and ask again where Christina is and what's going on. Nicole and Jesse come over and sit next to me. I look at them and ask again. They take my hands and tell me that Christina's been in a car accident. The blood drains from my face, and I start to shake. I ask how serious it is. Nicole looks at me with tears streaming down her face and tells me it's severe. I look over at the Taylors and ask what hospital she's in so I can go be with her.Jesse clutches my hand tighter and says in a soft trembling voice, "She isn't in a hospital."I'm confused and look at the Taylors, who are sobbing heavily.Jesse gives my hand another squeeze, puts her arms around me, and whispers into my ear, "Christina didn't make it."My heart explodes in grief. I'm drained of everything that's in me. I can't believe it; it's not right! I'm trembling and weak as I look at the officers and ask what happened. They explain that a drunk driver ran a red light, hit the driver's side of Christina's car, and flipped it. They tell me she felt no pain, that her death was instantaneous.I'm cold inside. Dark and cold. Dark, cold, and empty. And nauseous.My head sinks into my lap, and tears pour from my eyes. Anger--stiff, cold, intense rage rises within me, more anger than I've ever felt in my entire life. I stand and ask where the driver is, that I'm going to kill him; I'm going to take his life as he's taken Christina's. An officer stops me by putting his hands against my chest and tells me there's no need because he died in the accident too. He guides me back to the couch and sits me down.My energy drains; I'm utterly empty inside.The darkness in my heart hurts. I've never experienced anything like this before; the pain is unbearable.I look at the Taylors again and feel their grief. It isn't fair, I tell myself. This brilliant, gentle, loving, kind girl has been taken from our lives. I remember Bob explaining why Christina is their only child and how they tried for years to get pregnant and couldn't. They were finally able to have Christina but were never able to get pregnant again. I look at Mrs. Taylor and her anguish. Moving to sit by her, I place my arms around her and give her a hug.Between her sobbing, catching voice, she chokes out, "It's all my fault. I sent her to the store to get a few things for dinner, and she was hit on the way."THE ACCIDENT! I remember the accident I saw on my way to get my letterman's jacket. That was Christina? Why didn't I know? Why didn't I go to her? Deep guilt enters my stomach; I feel sick again and heartbreaking sadness.Bob looks at me helplessly. Mrs. Taylor hugs me back, holding tight like she won't ever let go, and I don't want her to. Jesse has her arms wrapped around Nicole, and they're rocking back and forth.The officers give us their condolences, hand Bob some papers, and leave. We sit there, sobbing...alone and barren.The sickness in my stomach intensifies.Thinking back to the last time I saw Christina, I gave her a kiss but didn't tell her how much I loved her. My heart sinks further, and my stomach is a bottomless pit of misery. I give Mrs. Taylor another squeeze. I have no words; I can think of no words; there's nothing to say, only deep, deep sorrow to feel.Eventually, I ask what I can do, and they answer that there's nothing, nothing anyone can do. So, we sit for hours, but time doesn't matter; the only thing that does is Christina isn't here; she's gone...gone forever.My sweetheart is gone. My soulmate is gone.I'm lost. I'm alone and lost. I'm alone, lost, and empty. Utterly empty.I know I can't stay all night, so I ultimately tear myself away and go home. It's gut-wrenching to leave, worse than anything, but I'm in the way, and it's better for them that I'm gone.When I get home, Dad asks how dinner was, but I can't answer; When I drop onto the couch, he asks what's wrong. I tell him, and the floodgates open. I can't stop sobbing. Dad sits down and wraps his arms around me. This is the first time he's ever shown compassion towards me, and I sit there bawling while he holds me tight in his arms.We speak of Christina and how I feel lost and empty. He tells me that I need to be strong for the Taylors and for her friends. That doesn't make sense to me; I don't understand why I'm the one that has to be strong. I get up, go into my room, and lay on my bed, staring at the ceiling through watery eyes. Looking at the plaque that Christina made for me, I begin crying again. That day seemed like yesterday--a yesterday that was long ago. Everything I see and everything I feel reminds me of her. She's my world, and my world is gone.Thursday, March 3rdMy watch alarm goes off, and I don't know if I even fell asleep; I only know I need to pull myself off my mattress and go to practice. I don't want to leave my room, go to the pool or school, or anywhere else for that matter; all I want to do is lie on my bed and cry. Dad's words echo through my mind, and I realize that all I'm doing is feeling sorry for myself. I'm not doing any good just lying here, so I get cleaned up and go to practice.When I walk into the locker room, I sit on the bench and drop my head into my hands. I know I have to do this, but I don't want to. The coach calls me into his office."What's wrong, Tom?"I sit there staring at him, trying to hold back the tears, but it doesn't work. Seeing my emotion, he shuts the door and takes the chair beside me."Talk to me, Tom," he says. "Tell me what's going on."Taking a deep breath, I groan as I explain what happened.The coach exhales deeply and sits back in his chair. There's emotion in his eyes as he sits there watching me."I'm sorry, Tom," he says. "I didn't know." There's a long, silent pause before he asks, "How is Christina's family doing?""She's their only child," I answer. "They're devastated."The coach lowers his head, and the heavy feeling in the room intensifies."How are you doing?"I look at him, wondering what kind of question that is. He can see how I'm doing; I can't hold myself together."I don't know, Coach," I say. "I feel empty and lonely. I don't know what to do without her. She means everything to me; everything I've done, I've done for her."The coach looks at the ground and then back at me. Then, putting his hand on my shoulder, he gives it a squeeze. I think about the words that just came out of my mouth and wonder how it's possible that a person, Christina, became so important to me in such a short amount of time. I think about how we met, how she helped me adjust to this school, how she gave herself to me, and my heart sinks again as the tears flow."Tom," the coach starts out slowly, "I need you to listen to me for a minute. What I say won't make sense right now, but it will as you think about it. There are basically two ways to respond to this tragedy."I look into his eyes and see how earnest he is and ask, "What do you mean?""Well," he says, "you can either give up and let the grief consume you, or you can honor Christina and dedicate everything you do to her memory."That thought startles me: Give up or honor Christina. There isn't a choice here.The coach continues, "What would Christina want you to do?""Not give up, that's for sure," I answer. "I know she wouldn't want me to sit around and sob. The last time we talked about our future, we spoke about going to college together, swimming, and someday, getting married."His voice hitches when he continues, "Okay then...let's try something. It won't be easy, but let's give it a try anyway.""What's that?" I ask."When you're out there swimming, think of Christina. Think of all the good things you remember about her. Let those happy memories engulf you and then channel that energy," he says. "Devote all your actions to her, to honor her, and be the type of person she'd want you to be."I sit there and try to digest what he's saying. Instead of moping around missing her, he's suggesting I focus on what she'd want me to do and who'd she'd want me to be.He gives me the option to skip practice, but being in the water, doing laps, always soothes me and helps me think, so I decide to see if I can do what he suggests.It's challenging, but it helps to think about our happy memories, her smile, her twinkling eyes, and it's like she's right here with me. This brings a smile to my heart. It feels so much better than wondering what life will be like without her.I come out of practice and see Jesse and Nicole waiting for me. Tears well up in my eyes again as I approach them."You came to school today?" I ask."Yeah, sitting around at home just makes me cry," Jesse says."It's going to be hard to be here without her, but I have to face up to it sometime," Nicole says.We give each other hugs and walk to our classes. Nicole and I sit at our desks, and almost in unison, put our heads down to hide our emotions. Looking at the empty chair in front of me is unbearable. The teacher asks where Christina is, but I can't answer with the knot in my throat. I look at Nicole, and she's pale with tears trickling down her cheek.Right then, a student walks in and gives the teacher a note. Color drains from his face as he reads it. He looks at me and then at Nicole and takes a deep breath. Then, with a slight quiver in his voice, he explains what happened to Christina. Everyone turns to look at her seat, but it feels like they're staring at me, and I lose it. I get up and leave the room. I need to be by myself, so I go to the library and sit at the back table where it's quiet. I don't know how long I'm there before a counselor finds me and asks me to come to the office with her.We walk in, and Mrs. Taylor is there with Jesse, so I go to them and hug Mrs. Taylor tightly. I can feel her tears as my shirt becomes wet."What are you doing here?" I ask."I had to come and tell the school what happened to Christina," she answers. "And to sign the paperwork for Jesse.""Paperwork?" I ask.They both give me a strange look and break out in renewed tears.Jesse wraps her arms around me and buries her head into my chest as she says, "We didn't have a chance to tell you...or Christina," she says. "The Taylors adopted me. So I'm now officially Jennifer Taylor."I'm stunned, and when I didn't think I had any tears left in me, they flow again. These are tears of happiness and sadness. Christina has the sister she's always wanted. But they couldn't tell her, and she won't have a chance to enjoy that new relationship. Jesse has a permanent, loving, and stable home. The Taylors still have a daughter. Taking Jesse in my arms again, we hold each other tight. I don't know what's more comforting, her holding me or me holding her.The counselor asks us to come into her office and sit down. Jesse and I break our embrace, find chairs, and sit down. The counselor gives Mrs. Taylor a small stack of papers to sign."Why'd you need me in the office?" I ask the counselor."Because you can't just walk out of class," she answers. "And Mrs. Taylor asked for you.""Tom," Mrs. Taylor says, "Bob, Jesse, and I need you to know that you're part of our family. We know you have a family of your own, but you're also part of ours. We love you like the son we never had, and we don't want you to leave our lives."Mrs. Taylor gives me another somber hug as we sit there with tears streaming down our faces.Saturday, March 12thIt's been a week and a half since Christina's accident, and today is her funeral. The minister tells us that Christina's body was just a temporary home for her spirit. She still lives spiritually and has returned to God. I'm not a religious person and don't know about such things, but as I sit here listening, I really want to believe what he says.There were times when we were together that there seemed to be something more. We connected on a different level, and we seemed to be able to communicate without words. Our feelings for each other stretched out and penetrated each other.God, please let this minister be right!Christina's grave is at Forest Lawn, on a hill under an oak tree, overlooking the valley. I'm standing here listening to the minister with her casket perched over a large hole. I'm wearing dark sunglasses so nobody can see my red, tear-laden eyes. Standing on my right is Jesse. I have my arm around her shoulders, and she's grasping my other hand tightly. On the other side of me is Mrs. Taylor. My heart breaks as I look at her. Finally, the minister finishes, and before they lower Christina's casket into the ground, I place some flowers on top of it.I remember the one time when I dropped her off at home, and we said goodbye, and when she shut the door, it felt like a barrier to a void I couldn't cross. This is worse. This is final.***************Friday, May 20thIt's been almost three months since Christina died, and it's hard...very hard. It's a chore to focus and keep up in school; everything reminds me of my sweetheart--all day, every day.I ask my boss if I can work more hours and use that time to keep myself busy and my social life to a minimum. Graduation is around the corner, and I'm anxious when I think about it.I'm looking forward to this summer when I go to college and start my swimming career. The change in scenery will do me good.The university coach and some of the team members came to Christina's funeral, which was nice. There was a large turnout with all the people from school, the community, and her family. Even my dad showed up, which meant a lot to me.Bob gave me a key to their house with strict instructions to either call him Dad or Bob and for me to call Mrs. Taylor either Eileen or Mom. They told me to come over whenever I pleased, day or night, that I was welcome. I give them copies of my work schedule each week, so they know when I'll most likely show up.Dad understands and doesn't get on me when I come home late because I'm with the Taylors, he even splits the chores with me now, so I'll have more time to spend with them.My friendship with Nicole has slowly drifted apart while Jesse and I have become closer. It's easy to hang with her because we aren't looking for relationships with anyone. Hell, I can't even find it in myself to go out and do things socially. It just doesn't seem right.It's comforting when Jesse lays her head on my shoulder or puts her head in my lap. I probably spend more time at the Taylors than at home. Jesse and I always eat lunch together at school, and sometimes Nicole and Clark will join us. Jesse and I have become close, like brother and sister.My swim meets went well; I won most of my events, and the coach continued to ride me when he saw I wasn't trying as hard as I should. Also, Jesse came to just about every one of my meets, which helped...a lot.The university coach is understanding and calls occasionally to check up on me. I attended their meets as often as possible, and his pep talks were always inspirational and motivating. Now that the swim season is over, I've signed my National Letter of Intent and am locked into going to UCLA.A few weeks after Christina's funeral, I asked my college coach if someone could take Christina's place to go to the university with me. He said yes, as long as they had the required GPA at graduation. He asked who it was, so I told him about Jesse and that she has the GPA but hasn't filled out any college applications. She's prepared to go to a city college for a couple of years and then transfer if she has to, but it would be nice if we could start school at the same time. He agreed and asked for her application, telling me that he'd take care of the rest.Sunday, May 22ndJesseI'm stressed and don't know what to do. Mom and Dad are in the living room watching television. I'm afraid to approach them with my problem, but I have no other way to solve it. So, I take a deep breath, walk in and sit down on the couch opposite them."Mom...Dad...I have a problem I need help with," I say.Dad turns the television off, and they look at me."What's the problem, sweetheart?" Mom asks."Well...uhm...," I have a hard time getting the words out. "Uhm...the prom is coming up, and there's a guy I want to go with, but I know he doesn't want to go and will be freaked out if I ask him.""Oh, I doubt he'll be freaked out, Jesse," Dad says. "He's probably intimidated by you and is afraid to ask you out. But, I'm sure if you drop hints, he'll get the courage to ask you.""I don't think so," I say softly. "Uhm...it's Tom.""Oh!" Mom says quietly. "It's only natural he doesn't want to go given how hard Christina's death has been on him.""I know, but...," I stammer. I have to get this out but don't know what their reaction will be. "Uhm...I really like Tom. I have for a while. I mean...uhm...even while he was dating Christina." I get choked up as I force the last sentence out. My eyes water, and I'm hoping they don't freak out. "I never acted on my feelings because of Christina.""You like Tom?" Dad asks."Uhm...yeah."Mom and Dad look at each other. Emotion shows in their eyes, and I can only imagine what they're thinking."Isn't there someone else you'd rather go with? I mean, that's going to be really hard for him," Dad says."Uhm...well...there are a couple of guys that have asked me, but I told them I wasn't interested in going.""What about Mark?" Mom asks."Uhm...yeah...he's one of the guys that asked me.""Oh. I see," Mom says."So...you really want to go with Tom?" Dad asks."Yes. I can't explain how much.""Do you want me to have a talk with him?" Dad asks."GOD, NO!" I panic as I say, "That would be totally embarrassing. What would he think? You telling him? Letting him know I want to go with him?""Does Tom know how you feel about him?" Mom asks."No...uhm...I don't think so...No, I'm pretty sure he doesn't. For all he knows, I love him like a brother and nothing else.""You love him?" Mom asks."Uhm...well...yeah. Sorry.""Don't be sorry, Jesse. He's a great guy. We love him too...not like you do, of course, but he's like a son to us," Dad says."I know...and I'm your daughter.""Oh, sweetheart!" Mom says as she gets up and sits next to me, taking me in her arms and holding me. Tears flow from both our eyes. Mom can see how upset I am about this, and I know she's upset about it too.
"Jesse," Dad says, "you know that we love both of you. Yes, it'll be hard to see Tom go out with someone else, but it's going to happen sooner or later, and it'll be easier for us to see him go out with you rather than someone else."I look up at Dad, and my breath hitches. "Really?"Mom hugs me tight and tenderly kisses my cheek. "Really," she says."So, it won't be weird then?" I ask."I didn't say that," Dad says, "but we'll support you in this. I have no idea how to get Tom to say yes, but if you want to try, you have our blessing."Tuesday, May 24thTomThe Senior Prom is coming up, and I don't want to go. Mark said he asked Jesse, and she told him she wasn't interested in going to the dance. Jesse and I sit at lunch with Nicole and Clark, arguing with them that we don't want to go to the dance. Eventually, Nicole wins out and talks us into it. Something about this being a once-in-a-lifetime chance and that we'll always regret not going. I give up and tell Nicole that I don't know who to ask, but she tells me not to worry about it, that if I don't ask someone, I'll get invited to go. Just give it until Friday.Jesse thinks about going back to Mark to see if he asked someone else, but she hasn't gone on a date with him since Christina died and feels awkward about going with him.Friday, May 27thI have the night off with nothing to do, so I go over to Jesse's to hang out with her. We decide to watch a movie, and Jesse stretches out on the couch, on her side, with her head in my lap. The subject of prom dates comes up again."I just don't know who to ask. In fact, there isn't anyone I really want to go with," I tell her."Don't worry, I don't have a date either, so we're in the same boat.""What about Mark?""He already asked someone else. Besides, I'm not interested in going out with him anymore."There are a few moments of silence, and then she says, "I have an idea, but it's kinda out there.""Let's hear it. It can't hurt.""Let's go together, you and me."I look down at her, and she's serious. "You want to go with me?""What, you find me too offensive to go to a dance with?""Are you kidding?" I ask. "You're the most beautiful girl in the school. But you're like my sister, and I didn't even think about going with you. Why would you waste your time going with me anyway?""Waste my time?" she asks. "I know six girls that are waiting for you to ask them to prom.""No way.""Way," she says. "Each of them asked me if you're going with someone, and I told them no.""I don't know...I'm just not ready to ask anyone out, not even to prom.""I know. That's why I thought it might work if we went together."Bob and Eileen walk into the room to find out what all the brabble's about, and Jesse tells them her idea, and they both smile."You find this amusing, Bob?" I ask."What? You don't want to take my daughter to the prom?"That set me back. I've never heard him refer to Jesse as his daughter before, though I know they both feel that way about her.I stutter, "It's not that I don't want to. I just think it might be weird, that's all.""I can't think of a better guy we'd rather have our daughter go with," Eileen says."Wouldn't that be like a brother and sister going together?" I ask."You can look at it that way, or you can look at it as two people who have a lot in common going together to have a good time," Bob says.Have a good time? I don't know if I'm ready to go out and have a good time. I give a deep sigh. I'm being ganged up on and don't realize it until it's too late. It's not that I don't like being with Jesse. In fact, it's quite the opposite. When I'm with her, things are simple. We connect on many different levels, and while we don't always agree with each other, our discussions are always comfortable. I think back to when Jesse and I have done things together. Even when Christina was with us, we had fun together, whether at the movies, bowling, or just going somewhere to get something to eat."Okay, let's do it," I say in a resigned voice."Hey! I'm no mercy date!" Jesse argues. "You're in, or you're out. If you're out, you can take your chances with one of those six girls.""NO!" I say, "I'm in." I get on one knee, jokingly, and say, "Jennifer Taylor, will you go to prom with me."She squints her eyes at me and responds, "Why yes, Tom Griffin, yes, I will."She throws her arms around my neck and gives me a kiss on the cheek, which sets me back, because I'm not ready for it, but instead of making it a big deal, I take it in stride.Bob stands up, walks over, and shakes my hand. "Good man. I knew you'd come through."Saturday, June 11thIt was a struggle to get a tux rented on such short notice, but Jesse wasn't all that picky about the colors, so I was able to find one last week.Tonight is prom, and I stand at the Taylor's door with a knot in my stomach. I don't know why. I just know it's there. When I knock, Bob answers with a questioning look as he lets me in."Why'd you knock?""Because I'm here to pick up my prom date and thought it appropriate."He nods and compliments me on how I look. A vision rolls through my head of the last time I stood here in a tux, and I shiver. I try not to be emotional about it, but, as often is the case, when I think of Christina, there's a longing in my soul that tears at me.Jesse steps to the top of the landing and walks down the stairs elegantly. The last time I saw her before a dance, she was kind of clumsy in heels, but not now. She glides down without hesitation. Her hair is pinned up with a few thin tendrils cascading around her bare neck. She has on a mint green gown that comes to the floor with a slit to her knees. Her heels are emerald green, like her eyes, and compliment the pendant that hangs around her neck. She's wearing drop earrings that are long and elegant. Everything about her is exquisite and beautiful. She walks to me, and I put her corsage on her right wrist. Eileen is busy taking pictures the whole time."Tom," Jesse says, "I wondered...if you'd mind...if I wore this...?"She opens her hand to reveal the tennis bracelet I gave Christina on Valentine's Day, and my breath leaves me. I haven't seen it since the last day I saw Christina. She was sitting at the lunch table when I held her in my arms and kissed her, telling her I would miss her. I miss her so much! Tears well up in my eyes, and my soul quivers."It would be like a part of Christina coming with us," Jesse says. "She loved this bracelet and never took it off." Then, taking my hand, she sets it in my palm."It doesn't go with anything that you're wearing," I say."I know. I don't care," Jesse says.I look in my hand and fight back the tears forming in the corners of my eyes."Tom, we feel that you should have the bracelet," Eileen says. "It does no good sitting in Christina's jewelry box, and it would mean more to everyone if you had it."I look at it again, feeling its weight against my skin. A tear runs down my cheek and hangs precariously from my jaw, so I wipe it away with the back of my hand. I would be embarrassed in front of anyone else, but because we've shared so many tears, they understand what I'm feeling."Thank you," I say. "I think Christina would want that too."I take Jesse's hand and clasp the bracelet around her left wrist. It looks beautiful on her. Bob tosses me the keys to his new car and tells me to drive it to the dance.We have dinner at a nearby restaurant and then go to the school gymnasium, where the dance is. I walk around to the passenger side of the car and open the door, and Jesse holds her hand up so I can help her out. She stands, puts her hand on the back of my neck, and gives me a kiss on the cheek. She's beautiful. Jesse insists on holding hands as we walk into the gym, and as we step through the doorway, it's like we're transported into another dimension.We dance and talk like it's our first time together, yet we are as familiar as if we've known each other our whole lives. Every slow dance is a treat. I love holding her in my arms.When they play True, it brings back memories of the last time we danced to that song, and I tighten my hold around her waist. She looks up at me with pleading eyes, and I want to put my lips to hers but don't dare. The band follows that song with Open Arms by Journey, and our slow dance becomes emotional.Jesse's eyes get wet as she gazes at me. She puts her arms around my neck and buries her face in my chest as we circle the dance floor. I rest my chin against the side of her head and smell her sweet perfume as it drifts into my nostrils. When she pulls her head away, I look deep into her soul-piercing emerald eyes, and in one motion, she slides her fingers into my hair and pulls my lips to hers. It's a soft kiss, gentle and warm. Our lips linger as the strawberry flavor from her lipstick intoxicates me. She lets go of my head, and I lean back."I'm sorry," she says. "I shouldn't have done that."My feet stutter as I reel in my emotions. Jesse feels warm and inviting, but my thoughts go to Christina. She's not here, but I feel guilty anyway. I look into Jesse's eyes, and I'm drawn to her and torn. The longer our eyes are connected, the more I'm pulled into her, and my guilt dissipates."I'm not," I say softly as I slowly lean in and kiss her back. We're more passionate this time, working to find our places in each other's hearts. Our lips part at the same time, and we gaze back into each other's eyes."This is going to be complicated," I say."I know, but I think it'll be worth it."The next song the band plays is Baby I'm a Want Ya by Bread. She puts her face back against my chest and clasps her arms around my neck tightly. Wrapping my arms around her waist, I hold her firmly. My guilt returns, but my brain justifies my actions by reminding me that Christina isn't here anymore and I need to move on. My heart follows my mind by telling me that Christina would want this since we can't be together. I already love Jesse, and it wouldn't be a far chasm to cross to develop that love into a romance. I'm already on the bridge; all I have to do is finish crossing over.It doesn't matter if the music is fast or slow for the rest of the night; we dance the same. Then, finally, we move off to a corner to be somewhat alone as we dance and hold each other. And kiss. The culmination of the night comes when the band plays Can't Fight This Feeling by REO Speedwagon. The way she looks into my soul when we hold each other makes me think of nothing else but her.Taking Jesse home after the prom, my guilt and sorrow multiply exponentially. I don't understand what's happening to me. When we danced, I felt close to her, extremely close, but when we are apart, I can only think of Christina. It's been a few months since she died, and I still feel the grief of losing her, sometimes to the point where I'll lie in bed and sob. My heart tells me that I've betrayed Christina, but my brain tells me I haven't. I'm confused; what've I done? What was I thinking? I walk Jesse to her door, and she leans in to kiss me, but I stop her by pressing my index finger against her soft lips."I can't, Jess, I can't. I don't know what's happening to me. It felt nice when we were dancing, but now, I just can't."Tears form in Jesse's eyes as she inhales deeply. Her breath catches as she looks down, not saying a word. Unclasping the bracelet from her wrist, she places it in my palm, and I look at it before balling my fist tightly. Pulling Bob's car keys from my pocket, I hand them to her. The sadness in her eyes and on her face breaks my heart. Now it's not just me that's hurting inside. She is too. What have I done?Jesse opens the door and walks in, not looking back. Watching the door shut reminds me of the time when Christina closed that same door, and it felt like a barrier to me. That same void is in my soul, leaving me lonely. That same barrier is there, but this time protecting me from violating my loyalty towards Christina. There is something else besides the loneliness, heartbreak, and tears...there is relief. I'm confused again. How can I be relieved that Jesse is on the other side of the door, not pressuring me to kiss her? How can I be lonely at the same time? What the fuck is wrong with me?I get home and drop on my bed without changing. The feelings in my heart swirl around, and I cry. Looking at the plaque on my wall, the tears come harder. I can't believe I kissed Jesse. It felt so right at the moment, but now it feels so wrong. I fall asleep and dream of Christina crying. I reach out to touch her cheeks and wipe away the tears, but she suddenly becomes mad. Her eyes squint to slits, and her face turns red. She wants to say something, but nothing comes out. Then, she returns to crying before turning her back on me and walking away.Sunday, June 12thMorning comes, and I wake with a start, realizing I'm crying again, or is it still? I'm tired and drained. I didn't sleep well with all the tossing, turning, worrying, crying, and the dream of Christina being mad and upset. I stand up and remove my tux. When I turn the pants upside down to straighten the creases, the bracelet falls from the pocket. Leaning over, I tenderly pick it up. Placing it on my dresser, I straighten it before sliding my finger along the blue stones. There are so many memories attached to this small piece of jewelry. Picking it up by each end, I clasp them together before setting it back down on my dresser. Maybe I should just let Jesse have it...if she wants it. What am I going to do with it? It's not like I'm going to give it to another woman. Maybe Eileen should have it. I'm confused...again, and tears begin to fall down my cheeks...again.I decide to visit Christina's grave to see if that will console me. As I'm walking out the door, the phone rings. It's Jesse."I'm sorry about last night, Tom.""I'm sorry, too, Jesse. I shouldn't have let it go that far.""Are we still friends?" she asks with a quiver in her voice."Jesse, you will always be my friend. Always."I can hear her sigh on the other end of the line, and tears form in my eyes...again."Tom?""Yes?""Can we see each other today and talk about last night?""I'm on my way out the door to return my tux and then go to the cemetery.""Can I join you?""Sure. I'll pick you up in ten minutes.""See you then."Hanging up the phone, I grab my tux and shoes before heading out the door. It's a short drive to the Taylor's, and Jesse is standing on the stoop waiting for me. She walks to my car as I pull up.After returning my tux, we stop by the store to get some flowers and then go to the cemetery. Sitting cross-legged on the ground, we stare at Christina's grave as we talk. It's as if we're waiting for her to chime in. It feels better to share our conversation while sitting beside her graveside, even though we both know she isn't there, only her body is."Jesse," I say," it's just too soon for me. I can't handle another relationship at the moment." I pause and stare at Christina's headstone. "Jesse. I love you. Really, I do. But my heart is torn, and I'm confused. I feel like I'm cheating on Christina, but when you're with me, the world seems right. I'm so confused."I tell Jesse about my dream, and tears well up in her eyes too."I understand. There's no rush and no reason to push things.""Thanks. It's so easy to talk with you, and I don't want to lose that. You know me and know what I'm going through better than anyone. Thank you for being patient with me and being there for me.""Tom?""Yes?""Would you do me a favor?""Sure, if I can.""Call me Jennifer.""But you don't like that name.""I like it when you say it, but please don't use it when others are around.""Okay, but will you tell me your middle name now?""Sophia.""Ohhhh...Jennifer Sophia...that's beautiful!""I suppose, but I still like Jesse better.""Not me! I love your name; it sings to me...Jennifer Sophia Taylor.""I'm glad." She pauses, and there's a long silence before she says, "You're the only one allowed to use it."I hear movement behind us and turn around. Bob and Eileen are walking towards us. Sitting down, they don't say a word; they just listen to Jesse and me. When there's a lull, they ask us about the prom and how it went. The tears well up inside me again, and I look at Jesse as she tells them about the wonderful time we had. She leaves out the part about us kissing and the emotions that followed and just gives them the highlights of the enjoyable evening."Tom," Eileen says, "we want you to know that we are thrilled that you went to the prom with Jesse. The two of you are so good together, and we love you both so much."I don't quite know what to say, but I follow my heart and tell her, "We had a good time. I love being with Jesse. It's difficult because all I can think of is Christina, but last night...well...I'm glad that Jesse asked me to go with her."Emotion shows in Eileen's eyes, and she leans over and gives me a hug. I stand, and everyone stands with me. Then, Eileen takes the step between us and hugs me again.This time she whispers in my ear, "It's okay, Tom. Christina would understand. I know she would want you and Jesse to be together since she can't be here." She kisses me on the cheek and then holds my face in her palms and looks into my soul. I begin to cry again."I have to leave," I tell them. "Jesse, would you mind getting a ride with your parents? I need to be alone right now.""Of course, Tom. I understand."I walk away and look back over my shoulder to see Jesse standing between her parents, with their arms around her.Leaving the cemetery, I drive without thinking of a destination and end up at Zuma Beach. I drive all the way to the end of the parking lot, where the mountain meets the water, Point Dume. I climb over the rocks to the little cove that nobody seems to know about and remove my shoes. The warm sand between my toes is comforting as I drop down and look out at the waves crashing against the shore. I wish, at that moment, I had a surfboard to sit on and feel the peaceful rise and fall of the swell. Instead, my mind drifts thinking about Christina, my dream, school, swimming, and Jesse. Emotions swell within me again, and my soul is in turmoil.I need to feel peace, and the only place I can find it is in the water, so I strip down, jump in the ocean...and swim.
