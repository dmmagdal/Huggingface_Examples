Chapter 13 -- The Trouble with TomSunday, January 24thWe step into the living room and sit down; Nicole, Jesse, and Mrs. Taylor give us worried looks, while Mr. Taylor looks angry."Where have you been!" her father barks."At Tom's. Nicole dropped us off there," Christina says defensively while gesturing towards Nicole.Her mother calmly replies, "We tried calling his apartment. The machine picked up. Would you like to try again?""I didn't hear the phone ring, or I would've answered it," I reply, trying to keep my wits about me.Mrs. Taylor looks Christina up and down and then asks, "Where are your clothes? And why is your hair wet?""I took a shower to get the sand and lotion off me. My clothes were sandy and sweaty, so Tom let me borrow some shorts and a t-shirt. Is something wrong?" Christina asks."We were worried when we learned you didn't come home with Nicole and Jesse, and we couldn't reach you at Tom's," her mom explains. "Have you had dinner?""Yes," Christina answers. "We had tacos."Mr. Taylor gets up, walks over to where we're sitting, and stares down at me. "When nobody answered your phone, I drove to your apartment to see if everything was okay, and nobody was there. Would you care to explain?""We left over an hour ago to get some...uh...." I stutter and point to Christina. "Tacos.""So Christina said," he grumbles.Standing in front of me, like a towering menace, Mr. Taylor's eyes don't leave me. His glare bores into me like lasers into soft metal. It's a good thing he doesn't have heat vision, or I'd be toast! Calm...just be calm...I repeatedly tell myself. I'm desperately trying, but my insides twist into knots with the thick tension in the room."Can Jesse and I go upstairs now?" Nicole asks in a quivering voice."Go ahead," Mr. Taylor says without breaking eye contact with me. He turns, walks over, and sits next to Mrs. Taylor, and they look at each other and then at us."You can't worry us like this," Christina's mom says. "You don't know how panicked we were that something happened to you.""We're glad you're okay," her father says. "Now, leave the room while we calm down."We go upstairs to talk with Nicole and Jesse. I need to find out why Christina's parents are so freaked out.Nicole explains that they were relaxing in the spa when Christina's parents came home. "They asked where you were, so I told them you were at Tom's. Your dad asked what you were doing there and why you didn't come home with us. So I said to him that you were going to hang out there for a while."When you didn't come home for dinner, your dad got upset. He tried calling Tom's, and when no one answered, he stormed out the door and drove over there. Nobody was home, which got him mad. He got back a few minutes before you guys walked in."I look at Christina and raise my eyebrows. "I've never seen your dad so mad. I hope he calms down.""Don't worry about him. He'll be fine. My parents try not to be overprotective, but sometimes they just can't help it. I'll change and spend some time with them.""Do you think I should leave?" Nicole asks."If you could hang for a little bit, it would probably help.""Sure, but not too long, though, because it's a school night."Christina changes her clothes, and I follow the three of them downstairs. Christina gives her mom and dad a hug and sits next to them. Mr. Taylor looks at me, so I walk over and offer to shake his hand."Are we okay?" I ask.He stands up, looks me in the eyes, takes my hand, and shakes it."Yeah, we're okay. Christina's our only child, and the thought of something happening to her sickens us.""Sir, as long as I'm with her, she'll be safe. I will die before I let anything or anyone harm her. When we're together, you can consider me her personal bodyguard!" His face softens.Before leaving, I lean down and give Christina a kiss on the forehead and say goodnight.Monday, January 25thThe girls are at our usual table when I get to the lunchroom and sit next to Christina. I ask how the evening went after I left. Christina tells me that everything is fine and not to worry about it. We talk about school, my work schedule, swimming, and the upcoming dance. All three of them are pretty excited about the Winter Formal, even Jesse, which surprises me. When the bell rings, I get up and go to class.Later, during my study period, I notice Jesse staring at me."What's up, Jess? Something bothering you?""Uhm...well...No. Well...maybe.""Jess, it's me. C'mon, what's up?""Uhm...well...." There's a look of concern on her face. "When Nicole and I were in the spa, she told me that you, Christina, and her have this kind of love triangle going. Is that true? I mean, I saw both of them playing with you at the beach but--""First off, it's not a love triangle. I'm not in love with Nicole. And, yeah...Nicole played with you too.""I know...I'm still processing that. Nicole said the three of you have sex with each other whenever you want. I can't believe Christina is okay with that.""It was her idea. She was curious what it would be like to be with another woman and arranged the whole thing with Nicole.""Really?""Yep.""What about you? Don't you mind?""Me? Not really...I mean...I'd prefer to leave Nicole out of the equation. Don't get me wrong, the sex is great, but I don't have a thing for Nicole. I mean...it's not that she isn't sexy...it's just that...well...I love Christina, and I want to be with her. I just don't want to be the jealous guy Christina leaves because I'm pushy about it. I can wait for her to get it out of her system.""What if she doesn't?""Doesn't? As in, doesn't it get it out of her system? I don't know. I guess I'll cross that bridge if needed. I don't think I will ever stop loving her.""What if you met a girl who loves you more than Christina...I mean...one that would be completely devoted to you?""I don't know, Jess. Christina is my world, and I can't imagine life without her."Jesse's face saddens. My heart drops, and I'm afraid I said something wrong. I'm about to ask Jesse what's on her mind when I see someone coming out of the corner of my eye. It's Christina. She looks like a woman on a mission. The hem of her flared skirt flops about as she quickly approaches.I nod at Jesse with a gesture toward Christina. Jesse turns her head and greets Christina, "Hey, girl. What's up?""Hey Jesse," Christina replies. She leans down and gives Jesse a quick hug from behind."Ears burning?" I ask."Huh? No, uh--""You look flustered," I interrupt. "What's up?""I got a pass to come here and study...I need your help.""Yeah? With what?"She walks over to my chair as I push it out and turn to her. She straddles my lap and sits down, facing me as she locks her lips against mine. Then, rocking her hips, she presses her pussy against my groin. One hand grasps my hair while the other holds my neck. I've never seen her like this; she's so aggressive, it's like she's trying to suck the life out of me, and I don't mind one bit. We hold each other tight as we come up for air, panting heavily and staring at each other. Jesse clears her throat."Sorry," I say to Jesse. "Sometimes when we make out," I pause, "it's like the rest of the world doesn't exist."Christina looks at Jesse and nods. Then, she quickly turns her gaze back to me and says, "I need you to fuck me. Now!" Her tone is insistent. I've never seen her like this before; it's like she's possessed by some sex goddess or something."Here? In the library?" I ask."We're in the back corner; nobody will see us.""Yeah, but...""I think I better leave," Jesse says."You can stay if you want," Christina says. "It's not like you've never seen us naked.""Yeah, but I've never been around you guys having sex," Jesse complains.Christina smiles and winks at Jesse. "Really. I'm okay with you watching, Jess. It won't bother me at all."During the conversation with Jesse, Christina unfolds her balled-up fist and drops her panties on the table. She then unsnaps my shorts and pulls my hard cock out. Lifting her ass off my lap, she hovers over me and drops onto my stiff rod. I figure we've gone this far, so it won't hurt to unbutton her blouse. Her bra clasps in the front, so I undo it to let her breasts free.Christina bounces on my lap while I take a tit in my mouth and suck on her nipple. My other hand holds onto her free boob and squeezes it. Christina pushes down on my cock and rocks her hips again, rubbing her clit against my pelvis. Pulling my mouth off her nipple, she presses her lips to mine, shoots her tongue into my mouth, and we play tonsil hockey as she resumes her bouncing. Slamming down on me one last time, she arches her back and moans into my mouth.When I pull my lips away, her head drops onto my shoulder, and her hot breath flutters against my neck. The whole thing went by so fast, I didn't have time to come. Christina gets off my lap and slips her panties on while I shove my cock back into my shorts.Standing up, she stuffs her tits back into her bra, buttons her top, and smoothens her skirt. "I don't know if that helped or made it worse." She bends over, kisses me again, turns on her heels, and walks away.I notice Jesse is still at the table, so I turn to her and ask, "What the hell just happened? That was really odd. I liked it, but it was odd.""Not much of a girlfriend to get you all worked up and leave you hangin' like that," Jesse says with a grin."Heh...good one, Jess." The sad face Jesse had earlier has been replaced by a disturbed but amused look. I can tell she's bothered by what we did and is trying to joke about it to ease the awkwardness. I'm about to apologize to her when the bell rings, and she quickly leaves the table.Before practice, I meet Christina at our usual place. She's waiting with a worried look on her face like something's on her mind."Sorry about the library. I was out of control.""Are you just saying that? Because I'm not sorry.""Not that it happened. But because of the way it happened, you know, with Jesse there and all."Jesse walks up just then, and they give each other a hug."I'm sorry about earlier; I didn't embarrass you too much, did I?" Christina asks."No. I think I may be getting used to your PDA."I laugh. "PDA? Shit...that was a little more than PDA."They chuckle, and Christina smacks me on the butt and says, "I need to see you tonight."I pull Christina into me, give her a big kiss, and say, "Remember, I'm working all week until Saturday.""Remember, I have a key to your apartment," she says with a wink.I kiss her again and go to practice.Friday, January 29thChristinaIt's been a whole week since I've been on a date with Tom. He's been really busy with practice and work. His first swim meet is in a few weeks, and the coach is riding them hard to make sure they're ready for it. His boss at work has been scheduling him just about every day because he knows that once Tom starts his meets, he'll have to give him extra time off.Just because it's been a whole week doesn't mean that we haven't seen each other, though. I met him at his apartment a few times when he got home from work. We did homework together, we talked, and if his dad wasn't home, we had sex. My mind drifts as I think about having sex with Tom.He just kissed me and told me he'd see me later. I love the way he kisses! Leaning against the lockers, I watch him walk down the hallway. His tight ass makes my heart flutter Those "holy" jeans of his Umph! I know what's under them, and being able to get a glimpse of skin through those holes, gets me wet. From behind, I hear a soft whistle and turn around."Wow...I'll never get tired of watching his ass," Nicole says."You and me both!"I hear footsteps stop behind us and turn around again."Whatcha' doing, guys?" Jesse asks."Watching Tom's ass," Nicole replies."Oh. Yeah. You have to admit...it's nice," Jesse says."Nice? I just want to...Umph!" I blurt out while holding my hands out like I'm squeezing his cheeks."You guys ready to go?" Nicole asks."Sure," Jesse answers at the same time I say, "Yeah."It's a good thing Nicole is driving us home. I can't get my mind off of Tom.The three of us walk in the door to find my mom carrying a laundry basket."Hey, Mom.""Hey, girls. What are you troublemakers up to this afternoon?""Not much," Jesse's first to answer. "I have some homework to take care of, and later, I'm going to the movies with Mark.""That's nice." Mom turns and looks at me. "Christina?"I have homework too. I hope to get it done before Tom and I go out tonight. Thankfully he's not working too late."Mom nods at me and then looks at Nicole. "And you?""I guess I'm the lucky one. I don't have any homework this weekend. But I don't have any dates either. So I guess it'll be just me, some ice cream, and some movies.""Well, call your mom before you do anything. She's looking for you.""Yes, ma'am."Mom smiles and walks down the hall with the basket while Nicole, Jesse, and I head upstairs. Jesse peels off to her room while Nicole and I go into mine. Nicole picks up the phone in my room and calls her mom. It's always interesting listening to a one-sided conversation."Hi, Mom. What's up? Yeah...uh-huh..."While she's on the phone, I change my clothes. I'm down to my panties, looking through my blouses, trying to decide what to wear tonight. I slide my panties down and try on a tight skirt and a loose blouse. I've really gotten into this commando thing. Nicole shakes her head when I turn around to get her approval. I keep looking through my closet after removing what I'm wearing.Tonight, Tom and I are going miniature golfing. After that, we'll go back to his place and hope his dad isn't home. It's been three days since we've had sex, and I can't wait to make love to him all night. The wait is killing me."Okay...sure...that's cool...sure...okay...no, not tonight...okay, I'll see you guys later." Nicole hangs up the phone and plops down on my bed."Everything okay?" I ask."Yeah. My mom and dad are going out and won't be home until late. They just wanted to check in with me, so I know what's going on," Nicole says. "Why not just wear jeans?""I want something easy to get out of," I say with a smirk.Nicole walks over and pinches my nipple. "What...you want Tom to diddle your pussy when you bend over to putt?" Nicole slides her finger between my folds and tickles my clit. "Hmm...you're already wet...maybe you want him to sit on one of the benches with you on his lap while he sucks on your nipple." Nicole flicks my hardened point with her tongue and then takes it between her lips and sucks.This causes me to moan uncontrollably. "Ungh! You know that's not fair. I'm dying to have sex, and you playing with me doesn't help."She squeezes my tit and moves her mouth over to my other nipple. I instinctively grab the back of her head and pull her mouth tight against my boob. Holding onto her, I walk backward and fall onto my bed. Nicole climbs on top of me, and we kiss. Having her lips on mine and her tongue in my mouth makes my insides flutter. She takes her hand off my boob and slips it down to my pussy to finger my clit again. I moan into her mouth and thrust my hips up against her hand. God, I want to fuck so bad!Nicole slides down my body and kneels at the side of my bed. Pulling me to the edge, she raises my legs, gently licks my clit with her tongue, and sticks two fingers into my wet cunt. She presses her fingertips against my g-spot, and I go crazy with lust. Her tongue slides down my labia and then back up to my clit, and then she sucks on it. I grab two fistfuls of sheets and hang on while I come. I'm trying to be quiet because I don't want my mom walking in on us."Get on your knees," Nicole demands.I do as Nicole says and turn over, sticking my butt in the air. She slides her fingers back into my pussy as she spits on my asshole. Nicole tongues my rosebud while pumping her fingers into me. I can't take anymore, and a grunt escapes my throat when my toes begin to tingle and my legs quiver. Losing my strength, I collapse on the bed. Looking up at Nicole, her face is sloppy with my pussy juices. She gives me a wicked grin while she swipes her tongue around her cherry red lips."There. Feel better?" She asks."No. Now I want to kiss you and eat your pussy."Nicole holds her arms out to welcome me into an embrace, so I accept it, and we kiss deeply."I have an idea," I say."What's that?""Let's go over to Tom's, and if his dad isn't there, let's fuck on Tom's bed. That way, we don't have to worry about being caught by Jesse or my mom.""Mmmm...I like it. Let me wash my face."Nicole helps me pick out my clothes for my date with Tom, and we knock on Jesse's door.There's a short pause before she yells out, "Hold on."Nicole and I look at each other, grinning, because we know exactly what she's doing in there, and we don't blame her one bit.Jesse's hair is disheveled when she opens her door. "What's up?""We're going over to Tom's and wait for him to come home from work. Do you want to come?" I know she won't, but I'd hate for her to feel like we're abandoning her."No. I'm good. Thanks. I'm going to finish my homework and then get ready for my date.""Sounds good, have fun," I say as Nicole and I walk downstairs.Before we leave, we find my mom in the living room."Mom, we're going over to Tom's to wait for him," I tell her, so she won't worry about us."Nicole, did you call your mom?""Yes, ma'am.""Honey, what about your homework?""Eh...I'll finish it later. I have all weekend.""Well, have a good time. Stay out of trouble!"We get to Tom's apartment, and Nicole finds a place to park around the corner. The sun is setting, and it's dark inside."It doesn't look like anyone's home. If he were coming home, Tom's dad would be here by now. The coast is clear." Nicole and I quietly walk up the stairs, and I unlock the door. Stepping inside, we lock the door behind us and turn on the light."You sure this is cool?" Nicole asks."Yeah, sure. I come here all the time. If it weren't cool, Tom wouldn't let me have a key.""Man! This apartment is small.""They don't need a big place. It's just the two of them."We walk into Tom's room and flip the light on. Nicole runs out to the front room and turns that light off, and when she returns, I'm waiting for her. I kiss her and then push her onto the bed. Flopping on top of her, I kiss her again, frantically this time. I ease up and lick her lips before kissing her earlobe and nibbling on it. Sitting up, I remove my blouse while she unbuttons hers. She leans up a little, so I reach around her back and unclasp her bra. Her nipples are already hard. Leaning down, I take one of them in my mouth, lick it, and then move over to the other and flick it with my tongue.I trail my kisses down her body and kiss her cute little belly button. Sliding down a little more, I undo her pants before pulling her zipper down. Then, I stand up, grab the edges of her pant legs, and pulling them down, taking her panties with them. They're bunched around her ankles as I remove her shoes and socks. She's naked on the bed, and she spreads her legs to play with her pussy.I quickly finish getting undressed and then lie on top of her, our tits pressing into each other as we kiss. I kiss her neck, and her hands hold my head tight against her. Moving down to her boobs, I kiss her mounds of flesh and lightly flick her nipple with my tongue. I continue my journey down her body and kiss the top of her mons as I caress her labia with my fingertips. I try to pull her lips apart with my fingers, but she's already drenched, causing my fingers to slip. So, I focus on her clit. Lifting her hood, I lick her clit before forming my lips around it and sucking. Her hips rock, but I hold on. Sliding a finger into her pussy, I curl it to meet her g-spot. Nicole comes, and her juices soak my hand, so I pull my finger out, lick it, and then stick my tongue inside her. Between my tongue and the suction I'm creating, I retrieve nearly all of her nectar from her hole. Some of her juices get away from me and flow towards her ass, so I follow them and lick her pulsing rosebud.
"Oh, Fuck! That feels good!" Nicole moans.I get on Tom's bed and lie on my back, with my head on his pillow. Nicole kneels over me, and we go at it in the 69 position. Nicole knows just the right way to lick my pussy to get me to come. Just as I let out a loud moan, I hear the front door open and close.TomWhen I finish my shift, I'm so tired I can hardly stand. I've been working late every night, so I can earn as much money as possible before my meets start in a few weeks. It hasn't been good for my relationship with Christina, but she seems to understand. I'm really looking forward to my date with her tonight. The only times we've seen each other lately have been when she's come over to my apartment after I've gotten off work. I'm hoping some food and a nice shower will help me wake up, so I stop at a drive-thru and grab a burger before going home.My boss wanted me to stay late tonight, but I asked him not to so I could go out with Christina. He's been so great with my schedule. If I need time off, he gives it to me. If I need to work more hours, he lets me. I don't know why he's so accommodating, but I'm not going to complain about it.Pulling up to my apartment, I look upstairs into the dark window. My dad is gone for another weekend. While this has been convenient for Christina and me, I wouldn't mind spending more time with him. Dragging myself up the stairs, I go inside and hear a woman moan in ecstasy. Dad's not here, and there's no light under his closed door. I flip on the front room light as I close the front door and hear more moaning. It's coming from my room? It sort of sounds like Christina, but why would she be moaning like that when she's alone in my room...unless...I open my bedroom door slowly, expecting to see Christina masturbating. Instead, Nicole and Christina are eating each other out. There's nothing like seeing two women having sex to give a guy some needed energy. I immediately pop a boner.Looking over at me, they smile, their faces shiny with pussy juices. I drop my stuff on the floor and lean against the door jamb and fold my arms."Well...what do we have here?" I ask."Uhm...Nicole and I got a little carried away.""A little? Is there room for me, or is this an exclusive romp between the two of you?""There's definitely room," Christina says.Nicole gets off of Christina, who turns over and gets on her knees. Nicole flips around and kneels next to Christina, both of their asses at the end of my bed."Fuck me, Tom," Christina moans."Me too," Nicole says.Shit, I don't have to be told twice. Both of these hot girls want me to fuck them at the same time. Quickly getting out of my clothes, I move to the end of the bed and stick my fingers into their pussies."Wow. You gals sure are wet," I say."Two orgasms will do that," Christina says with a lilt in her voice.I slide my cock into Christina while keeping my fingers in Nicole. I don't take time to warm up like I usually do and thrust into Christina hard. My fingers keep the same cadence in Nicole as my cock does in Christina. They look at each other and kiss, which gets me even harder. My balls tense as they're about to release a load of hot cum. Pulling out of Christina, I pump my cock a few times and then spray Nicole's ass with my white cream. Thrusting my cock into Nicole, I now finger finger-fuck Christina. I'm not worried about them having an orgasm before me...they already had theirs, so I focus on coming again."Come in my ass," Nicole demands.There's cum in her crack, so I use my thumb to spread it around her asshole, sliding it in and out as I fuck her. Nicole bucks her hips against me, and the sound of slapping skin echoes off the walls. My cum drips down to her pussy and coats my cock as I continue thrusting into her.Pulling my fingers from Christina causes her to look back at me. "Christina, get under Nicole and eat her pussy while I fuck her ass," I tell her.Christina moves quickly and slides under Nicole. When I feel her tongue against my rod, I pull out of Nicole's pussy and press my cockhead against her rosebud. I coat my head with the leftover cum in her crack and push my cock into her ass. Even though I've had anal sex with Nicole a few times now, I still go slow, letting her get used to the invasion of my pulsing shaft. I'm pushing in slowly when Nicole thrusts her hips back against me, driving my cock all the way into her. She groans, pulls away, and then drives my cock back into her ass again. Grabbing her hips, I use them to keep our rhythm and fuck her hard. My balls hit Christina's nose as we fuck, and every now and then, I feel her tongue swipe at a swinging testicle."I'm going to come, Nicole.""Fuck! Yes!"My nuts contract and pulse as they send hot cum up my shaft and into her ass. I drive all the way in and hold myself there until I finish emptying my balls. Then, I pull out slowly, and cum drips out her ass towards Christina's nose.I smack Nicole's ass and tell them to have fun while I take a shower. Christina slides out from under Nicole and says she's going to take one with me. Nicole jumps up and wants to join us, so we head into the bathroom to clean up. Nicole sits down on the toilet while Christina and I get in the shower and wait for the water to get hot.Christina squirts some soap into her palms and lathers my chest and arms. She has me turn around to massage my back. Nicole steps into the shower, gets her hands soapy too, and kneels down to take care of my ass and legs. They tell me to turn around, and they grab my cock and wash it along with my balls. Having their tits slide against my chest and their hands pumping my cock as they wash me gets me hard again."Keep this up, and I'm going to have to fuck you both again," I warn."Have to? Don't you mean you'll get to?" Nicole chuckles.I flip Nicole around and pin her against the wall. Pulling her hips out, I bend my knees to get my cock at the right angle and then thrust it into her wet pussy. She moans as my cock saws into her.Christina moves to her side and kisses her before saying, "I think he means 'have' to."I fuck Nicole until I come again, and then Christina pulls my cock out from under her and slips it into her mouth, sucking our combined juices from it. Nicole then turns around, reaches up, and gives me the most passionate kiss I've ever had from her."You can fuck me anytime you want," Nicole says as she smacks my ass.Christina stands up and kisses Nicole, sharing the cum she was able to get off my cock. Watching those sexy little minxes make out fills me with lust. I want to fuck Christina again, too, but she tells me to wait until after our date tonight. We finally finish washing and then get dressed."Nicole, do you want to go golfing with us?" Christina asks."As much fun as that sounds, you two need some alone time," she answers.Nicole leaves in her car as Christina and I drive off to enjoy our date together.Saturday, February 6thIt's been a long week. Between work and preparing for our first swim meet, I've been swamped. The only time I really saw Christina was at school. I know she wants to go out at least once a week, but I just didn't have it in me. I woke up later than expected and immediately started cleaning the apartment. I want to get it done as soon as possible, so I can call Christina and hang out. I'm in the kitchen cleaning the sink and stove when there's a knock at the door. Opening it, I find Christina and Jesse standing there. I'm surprised because Christina didn't say anything about coming over today. I let them in and shut the door."Hey, what are you doing?" Christina asks."Cleaning. How'd you get here?""We have my parent's car. We're going shopping, and we wondered if you wanted to come with us.""Uhm...I remember what happened the last time we went shopping," I answer."It won't be like that; it'll just be the three of us. We want to spend some time with you.""Uhm...I have quite a bit left to do. Mind waiting?"Christina looks at Jesse and then asks, "Do you mind if we help Tom with his chores?""Heck no."I tell them what's left to be done, and we split the chores, finishing in about twenty minutes. After getting dressed, we go to the mall.I haven't spent time with Jesse in a while. It's nice to be around her and catch up with what's going on in her life. We talk about the upcoming dance and what they're going to wear. The three of us sit in the food court, eating, talking, and enjoying each other's company. Now and then, I point to a guy who's checking them out, and they giggle. We decide to catch a movie and then some dinner afterward.When I'm with Christina, I feel complete. Holding her hand and having her head rest against my shoulder relaxes me. Christina is my soulmate, and I love her so much that I can't imagine being without her. Having Jesse with us is a bonus. She's so much fun to have around. She has stories about her life that an eighteen-year-old shouldn't. The things she's gone through and survived amazes me. She's a strong woman because of her trials and experiences. She doesn't put up with any nonsense, but at the same time, she's happy and smiling almost all the time. When I look into her green eyes, there's a sparkle in them that lights a part of me on fire.They drop me off at home, and Christina follows me to my door."Thank you for letting me spend the day with you guys. I had fun," I say."Thank you for going with us. Jesse has a very small circle of friends, and she misses hanging out with you.""We hang out all the time," I say."At school. That doesn't count. Besides, with practice and your work schedule, I really miss being with you too.""Ditto. I need to find a way to balance my time, so I can spend more of it with you. Since I'm not working tomorrow, can we go out? Maybe take a drive to the beach?""I'd love that.""It's a date then. I'll pick you up a little after nine?""That sounds perfect."Christina and I kiss. It's not frantic or hard, but soft and smooth. I sink my fingers into her hair and gently hold the side of her face in my hand. Her arms lock behind my neck, and we kiss...a long...sweet...soft kiss. She pulls away, and I immediately miss her lips pressed against mine."Goodnight. I'll be thinking of you while in bed," she says with a wink."Hmmm...I want to be there with you. Spend the night with me," I plead."I wish I could, but you know it's not possible."I dive into her lips and press her against the door as I kiss her hard. My heart pounds, and my breathing is strained. I want her but can't have her, not tonight anyway. Putting her hands on my chest, Christina pushes me away, and we catch our breaths as we gaze into each other's eyes."Jesse's waiting in the car," she reminds me."Uhg...right. Okay. I love you. Drive safe," I tell her."I love you too."She saunters down the stairs, looking over her shoulder at me as she goes back to her car. My heart reaches out for her, but she keeps walking. It's like my soul is merged with hers and being uncontrollably drawn from me. I miss her already. Tonight is going to be a long and lonely night.Sunday, February 7thI didn't sleep very well last night; I kept having fitful dreams of Christina drifting away. No matter what I tried, I couldn't catch nor reach her. It leaves me shaken. Dawn approaches, and it's no use trying to sleep, so I drag myself out of bed. I'm dying inside, trying to keep myself at home instead of being with my angel. I decide to do some homework to get my mind off how anxious I am to spend the day with Christina. It's difficult not to jump into my car and drive over to her house. The clock finally strikes nine, and it's time to pick up Christina.I eagerly knock on the door, and Mr. Taylor opens it. "Kind of early for a Sunday, isn't it?""Christina and I are going to the pier today.""She told me. Which one are you going to?""Redondo.""Why so far away. There are closer piers.""I know, but I really like that one.""Huh. Well, come in. She should be down in a minute."I stand in the entryway, remembering the first time I was here waiting for Christina. It seems like forever ago when it really wasn't. She finally bounces down the stairs wearing a pair of shorts and a tee-shirt."It'll probably be too cold to wear shorts," I tell her."Okay. Give me a minute to change."She runs back up the stairs and, in a few minutes, comes back down in her jeans. She's carrying a sweatshirt to put on when we get there.***************The salt air blows against our faces as we walk to the end of the pier and lean against the pier's wooden handrails. It's refreshing. Even though Christina is wearing a sweatshirt, she shivers, so I stand behind her and envelop her in my arms to warm her. She relaxes her head on my shoulder and lets out a long sigh. After kissing her cheek, I whisper in her ear that I love her. She smiles and nestles into me.The locals go on about their business as though we aren't even there. The nearby fishermen reel in their catch and drop it in their buckets. Kites are flying off to the side of us, hovering above waves that churn the sand as they break against it. One of the kites gets cut down."Oh no! Someone lost their kite," Christina cries."It's a game.""A what?""It's a game. They cut each other's kites down to see whose can stay up the longest.""Really? Why?""I don't know. It's just what they do. Want some lunch, or do you want to stay and see who wins?""Lunch sounds good."We walk into one of the restaurants and sit down. We're holding hands across the table as we look at the menu."Well...well...well. Look what the cat dragged in," the waitress says as she walks up to us.We drop our menus and look at her. It's Lindsay."Hey, Lindsay. When did you start working here?" I ask."I've worked here for a long time.""Huh. I didn't know."Christina glares at me as Lindsay and I talk. I look over at her and get the hint, so I introduce her."Christina, this is Lindsay. She taught me how to surf.""Taught you to surf...hah! I tried, but you moved away.""Lindsay, this is Christina...my girlfriend," I say with an emphasis on 'girlfriend.'Lindsay nods while Christina looks her over like she's sizing her up for a fight. We order, and Lindsay walks away."So...she's the one that taught you to surf but wouldn't speak with you at school?""One and the same.""Sounds like a bitch to me," Christina snarls in a catty tone."Naw. She's really pretty nice. It's just the way they are here."We finish our meal and then head down to the beach. Taking our shoes off, the cool sand squishes between our toes as we walk along the edge of the surf. Having my arm around Christina, I hold her close. She leans her head against my chest as we enjoy the cool breeze, salt spray, and each other.By the time I get Christina home, it's late. I've had a wonderful time with her and don't want her to get out of the car. She climbs onto my lap, and I hold her while we sit in front of her house. My arms are folded around her while her head rests under my chin. It's these quiet moments I cherish. I love having her in my arms and holding her. I could stay like this forever, but we eventually decide that she needs to go inside, and I need to go home.Friday, February 12thI'm at work thinking about how fast the week went by. Practice is getting more intense because our first meet is just days away. Christina met me at my apartment after work almost every night. At the beginning of the week, we had sex like animals; it wasn't making love--it was straight out fucking. I was happy when we began making love again because I enjoy the quiet calm of lying with her.Christina tells me that she and Jesse are becoming more comfortable around each other and that she's becoming like the sister she never had. She explains that sometimes it gets lonely being an only child. Even though Nicole was her best friend until we met, it's not the same, and now she's becoming closer with Jesse than she is with Nicole. She says they've shared personal things about their lives that they've never told anyone else. Christina seems to be both grateful and comforted that Jesse is living with them.***************I come home from work, and my dad's scurrying about the apartment doing stuff, off in his own world, while Christina's sits on the couch thumbing through a magazine. She's wearing a pink blouse and tight jeans; her heels match her top and fingernails. Her hair is freshly curled, and her perfume has a sweet flowery scent to it. I plop down next to her and give her a kiss. She tells me that she's hungry and to change my clothes so we can go eat.We're going out tonight, just to get some pizza and be with each other. Since the dance is tomorrow night, and we both have things to take care of beforehand, we're taking it easy tonight and not staying out late. My stomach growls, helping me realize that I'm hungry too, so I change, and we leave.Saturday, February 13thI wake up early because there's a lot to do; I have to clean the apartment, do the laundry, pick up my tux, buy Christina's corsage, and get ready for the dance. When I get home from running my errands, Dad reminds me of the things I forgot to do, and by the time I finish, it's three o'clock. I'm supposed to be at Christina's at five, so I clean up and get dressed. I'm walking out the door when Dad hands me a couple hundred dollars and tells me to have fun. This comes as a complete shock because he's never given me money before.I get to Christina's right on time, and her dad lets me in. He shakes my hand, tells me how nice I look, and says his daughter will be down soon. I stand there waiting for what seems like an eternity when I see something move in my peripheral vision. It's Christina descending the stairs as if she's floating on air. She is graceful, beautiful, elegant, and sexy; I've never seen a woman more stunning.She's wearing a long pink dress, and her hair has soft curls cascading past her bare shoulders. Her shoes match my charcoal cummerbund, and there are slits on the sides of her dress that go halfway up her thigh, revealing enough leg that both teases and tortures me. She's wearing a beautiful silver necklace with a charm that drapes down her neck and hangs just above the crevice between her breasts.She strolls over, and I kiss her. Her heels lift her to where her forehead touches my nose. She's wearing a perfume I've never smelled before, a hint of sweet spice that causes my senses to swoon. I hand her her corsage, and she asks me to pin it on her, which I do. Mrs. Taylor takes pictures while Christina's father watches me like a hawk, gauging my every move.The doorbell rings, and Mr. Taylor answers it. It's Mark. Mr. Taylor lets him in and tells him that Jesse isn't ready yet, and to follow him because he wants to speak with him.I look at Christina and ask, "His first time here?""Yep, and he's in trouble because he's never come to the door when he's picked Jesse up for a date."I chuckle, not envious of what he's about to go through. Jesse comes down the stairs a few minutes later, and she looks beautiful. She's a little awkward walking in heels, but she does great. Her hair is pulled up with a few tantalizing tendrils hanging down the back of her neck. A low whistle escapes me, and I get poked in the ribs because of it.
She walks over and says in a whisper, "This is way too girly for me."We laugh, and I tell her how beautiful she is. Mark emerges from the office and freezes as his face lights up. He greets Jesse with a hug like she's a fragile doll and pins her flower on while Mrs. Taylor takes pictures of them too.The doorbell rings again, and it's Nicole and Jim.Mrs. Taylor puts a new roll of film in her camera while the six of us get in position to pose. She goes crazy snapping pictures, nearly blinding us with the flash. Mr. Taylor stands there with his arms folded and a stern look on his face. Christina goes to him, reaches up, and kisses him on his cheek."Thank you, Daddy, you're the best," she says as he stands up straight again.He drops his arms and puts his hands in his pockets as his stern look melts. Out front, a horn honks, and Nicole asks who else is coming. Mr. Taylor opens the door, and Nicole sees the chauffeur holding the limo door open. She squeals, and the rest of us snicker at her response. Christina wanted it to be a surprise, and she pulled it off.Mr. Taylor leans over and whispers in my ear, "He has your itinerary and will wait to bring everyone back here after the dance.""Thank you," I say. "You're very generous.""Not at all," he says protectively. "I want to make sure the girls come back here after the dance and nowhere else."I smile and say to him, "Christina will be fine. I'll bring her home, safe and sound.""I know you will," he says in a deepened tone.Dinner is excellent, and the waiter treats the girls like royalty as he serves them. When we get to the dance, it's already started. I look around at the pink and white decorations with amazement, wondering who the heck did all the work.It's a fun evening, even when we mix it up and dance with each other's dates. Jesse and I dance to True by the Spandau Ballet. There's something about the way she looks at me, with that fire she has, that makes me feel guilty for dancing with her. When she's in my arms, I feel very close to her, like we're kindred spirits.The song ends, and Christina comes over, and we dance to Crazy For You by Madonna. She puts her arms around my neck and pulls me in close as we make slow circles on the dance floor. I listen to the words as I get lost in her gaze and kiss her deeply. She buries her face in my neck, and I can feel her love emanate. I love this woman with all my soul and can't imagine trying to survive a day without her.We take a break during a set of fast songs and sit at a table. A guy walks over and asks Christina to dance. She tells him that she can't right now, but maybe later. He walks away with his head down, slumped between his shoulders, and I feel terrible for him."Go ahead and dance with him," I say. "You don't realize how much courage it took for him to come over and ask you.""But I want to spend the evening with you, not dance with someone I don't know."I take her hands in mine and lock eyes with her. "You're the most beautiful woman, not only in this room but on the entire planet. If you dance with him, it'll probably make his life complete. Who knows, maybe he has a crush on you, and if you dance with him, it'll make his dream come true.""You sound as if you know this from experience.""That's how I'd feel if I could only have one dance with you. You are my dream come true."Christina smiles and walks in the direction of where the guy disappeared. A few minutes later, I see him guiding her to the dance floor, proud as a peacock, walking with her arm in his. He's shorter than Christina and wears thick, black-rimmed glasses that have tape holding the bridge together. He's awkward, but Christina doesn't seem to notice as they dance, talk, and laugh. When the song ends, he thanks her and starts to walk away, but she grabs his arm and asks him to dance the next one too. His face beams as he stays out on the floor with her. When the song is over, she thanks him, and they part ways."Thank you for getting me to do that," she says. "He's a really nice guy.""Thank you for doing that; as president of the Awkward Guys Club, I thank you."She laughs and kisses me as we sit, enjoying each other's company. Nicole decides she's also going to dance with him and hunts him down, and they dance for three songs. Jesse does the same, and when she walks away, another girl asks him to dance. Every time I look at the dance floor, he's out there dancing with a different girl.The last dance is Babe by Stix, and I take Christina by the hand and escort her to the dance floor for the final time. I hold her close as she puts her arms around my neck and tangles her fingers in my hair. She lays her head on my shoulder as I rest my head on hers, and we slowly sway to the music. Occasionally, she tilts her head up, and we kiss tenderly.Her hypnotic blue orbs penetrate me as she says, "This should be our song.""What do you mean?""This is the last dance of our first school dance, and this song will always remind me of the wonderful time I've had with you tonight.""As you wish," I say as I lean into her and kiss her with every fiber of my being.The night ends, and we pile into the limo and return to Christina's. We all go into the house, and her parents ask us how the night went. Christina, Nicole, and Jesse start talking simultaneously. I don't know how the Taylors understand anything; it sounds like gibberish to me as they excitedly tell them how much fun they had.Nicole, Jim, and Mark leave while I stand in the entryway with two beautiful women anchored on each side of me. I ask Mr. Taylor if it's okay to take the girls out for ice cream, but he only shrugs and says it isn't his decision. I look at Christina and Jesse, who both smile and shuffle off to change their clothes. Christina stops and asks if I'm going to change too. I tell her that I'd like to, but I don't have anything else to wear."Wrong," she says. "The clothes you lent me after we went to the beach are in my room."Mr. Taylor says I can borrow a pair of his sandals, so I run upstairs to change, and we all come out about the same time to go out for some ice cream.It's nice sitting there with Christina and Jesse, casually talking and laughing about the night. I take them home and stand on the doorstep with Christina while Jesse goes inside. Holding her in my arms, we kiss, and I thank her for asking me to accompany her. I tell her that anytime she wants to go to a dance, just jab me in the ribs, and I'll make it happen. I kiss her again, and she goes inside.
