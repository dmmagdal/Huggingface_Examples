NOTE: All characters are 18 years old.TW: F-slur used multiple times.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Brad Williams has been the jock for most of high school. He'd play football, basketball, soccer, hockey even, and got rewarded with trophies, medals, and the usual popularity that came with his position, along with an ever-rotating cast of girlfriends which caused him to leave a trail of broken hearts everywhere he went. Girls fell for him, they dated for like a month, and then he'd leave them behind to be with some other chick who'd fallen for him, which in turn he dated for like a month and then left for yet another chick who'd fallen for him. Get the idea? The problem was, I fell for him. And I'm a guy. So I definitely do not have any chance of being with him. Or so I thought.Let me tell you about myself. My name is Michael Ruiz, I'm 18 and a senior in high school. I guess you could call me a nerd? I get good grades and I like to read, which is apparently all it takes these days to be labelled one. And I'm gay, which I pretty much keep a secret except for to some of my close friends. Needless to say, I'd been lusting over Brad ever since the first gym class of the year, when I happened to look over and see him changing. All I saw was muscle, muscle, and muscle. And it all pretty much started there. Also needless to say, he's a jock. Which also means, by definition, that he's an asshole. And he is. He'd push people against lockers, he'd threaten people, he disrupted class, yada yada yada. One time he threatened me into a corner, and to be honest I don't know if I was scared or horny. Maybe both.Anyway, this whole story starts in, you guessed it, gym class. It had been a hot day, even for the time of year, and everyone was extremely sweaty by the time gym ended. Due to the temperature, the gym teacher told us this time showers were obligatory. Usually they're optional, but this time everyone was so smelly I understood the decision. It meant, of course, getting naked with a bunch of other guys, which in some circumstances would be great, but in this one not so much, since they could also see me.So we went into the showers, and my school's showers are just one big room with shower heads all around the walls, so there's absolutely no privacy. Everyone went to a shower head and began to shower, and I just happened to be showering to the right of Mr. Brad Williams, the jock of the school, the object of my deepest fantasies and desires. Now, I usually don't shower in gym class, so I'm taking a little opportunity to see what everyone's working with. I'm lathering up, trying so hard not to get hard (holding my breath, it actually works) and I just turned a little casually to the left and let my eyes drift downwards.And goddamn. This guy was hung like a fucking horse! It was barely soft and already at like 4 inches! Just imagine what it would look like at its full length! Seven inches? Eight inches? Nine?! Immediately I started to chub up at the thought, but I held my breath and sure enough, it didn't rise. Now of course I can't get enough of this. I'm shampooing, glance to the left. Lathering, glance. Rinsing, glance. And one of the times, I glanced and he was soaping up his dick. I nearly died right then and there. He massaged it, letting it drop and then grabbing it back up, sliding his balls through his fingers. At this point my glance had turned into more of a stare. I quickly caught myself and went back to my business, but not before risking a quick glance at his face.I looked up, and he was staring straight at me. FUCK!! I immediately turned and felt myself blush. Did he see I was looking? Is he gonna kill me? Am I gonna die today? Is he gonna expose me? I glanced again and he was still looking at me. But then he winked and turned back. Winked! Now I was intrigued again, my panic slowly being replaced by excitement. The rest of the time passed with nothing important happening, but I kept thinking about it. His wink. What did it mean? Did he like it? Did he like me? What's gonna happen now?The latter was answered shortly after school let out. I was walking home when his car suddenly pulled up next to me. I stop, slightly panicked, as he rolls down the window."I saw you looking at me during gym," he said casually."Uhh...listen I can explain," I started, panicked."Don't worry about it. I get it. It's big. The real question is, would you like to see more?"WHAT?! What do I answer? The answer is yes, of course, but I can't say that! But a small glimmer of optimism shone inside me and I said, tentatively:"Um...maybe?"He unlocked the passenger side door. "Get in."Without a word I walk around and get in the car with him. Without a word, he began to drive. After about five minutes he stopped in a semi-secluded parking lot, where he parked and reclined his seat. I looked over at him, and saw his bulge. He was fully hard, and it looked big too. Without a word he reached over, grabbed my hand, and put it on his bulge. I could feel the heat coming off of it, its firmness. I could feel my own dick straining against my underwear. I squeezed it slightly. Brad grunted softly."You like it?" he asked.I nodded."Do you wanna see it?"I nodded again and took my hand off. He reached down and unbuttoned his pants. Slowly he reached inside his briefs and pulled it out. His dick rose to be about seven wonderfully thick inches at its full length. I froze, not knowing what to do. I was blushing furiously, just staring at it. He broke the tension."You know you want it."I merely nodded again, speechless."Then get to it. Suck my dick, fag."I gulped. Hesitantly, I bent down towards his lap. Soon my face was close enough that I could feel his body heat on my face and smell the intoxicating aroma of teen hormones coming from it. I could even see that the thick head had a bead of precum on it. I went further down and slowly licked the head. Salty, from the sweat, but sweet, from the precum. He sighed. I kept going, licking around the head, and then putting my lips around it. I began to bob up and down on his dick, careful about the teeth, and using my tongue around the head. He began to breathe heavily, clearly pleasured from what I was doing. I tried to take it farther down my throat. I opened my mouth as far as it could go and went further down, but it didn't work. It hit the back of my throat and I gagged. I tried to pull off for air, but suddenly his hands were on my head, forcing me down. I went up a little bit to stop the gagging, but then he pushed my head down more. I tried to remember those tips from the internet. I relaxed my throat and began to breathe through my nose. And, somehow, it worked! It went down my throat, and he pushed my head down onto his lap."Oohh fuck!" he exclaimed, "That's so good!"My nose was in his shaved groin and I could smell his sweat. His musk went up my nose and enveloped my brain. But suddenly I couldn't breathe. I tried going up and he let me. I pulled off coughing and panting, drool dripping down my chin. But I didn't even have a moment of peace when he grabbed my head again and put his cock down my throat. At this point I knew what was coming, so I just let him. He held my head in place, his dick deep down my throat, and bucked his hips upwards, fucking my face."Oh fuck yeah! Suck it, fag! Suck my fucking dick!" he kept saying, but I couldn't even hear him at this point. I was so turned on. My dick strained against my jeans, but I couldn't care less. My entire focus was on Brad's dick. Drool dripped down my face and tears welled in my eyes as he fucked my face, using me like a fleshlight, a tool for his own pleasure. And somehow that turned me on even more. Soon he began to make shallow thrusts and breathe heavily, which told me he was close to cumming."Oh fuck! I'm so close! Don't fucking stop!" he moaned. Then he slammed my head down on his dick balls-deep and began to cum down my throat. I could feel spurt after spurt slide down, and I did my best to swallow, but it was so much, and soon some was leaking out of the sides of my mouth. He kept my head there the entire time. When he finished and I swallowed the last of it, he took his hands off my head and I went up, panting. I laid back in my seat, trying to catch my breath. Meanwhile, Brad was busy putting his dick back in his pants and looking around, as if someone was gonna see us in this dingy parking lot.Suddenly, he grabbed my collar, pulled me close to him, looked me in the eye, and said, "Look at me and understand: if you tell anyone about this, and I mean anyone, I'll fuck you up so badly your funeral's gonna be closed fucking casket. Understood, faggot?"I nodded, terrified. He roughly pushed me back, and said, looking forward, "My girlfriend broke up with me last week and I haven't gotten off since. You got a good mouth, for a guy. Here's my number," he slid a piece of paper towards me, and I took it, surprised. "If I text you to be somewhere at a certain time, you better be there. You're gonna be my personal hole when I can't get any other bitches, got it?"I nodded again. Without another word, he started the car and drove off. He dropped me off at my house and, shooting a small hello to my mom, I ran upstairs to my room and locked the door. I pulled down my pants and stroked my dick, remembering my experience earlier that day. It didn't even take five strokes when I began shooting all over myself. It was one of the biggest cums I ever had. After I cleaned myself up and changed I thought seriously about what had happened. He'd said I would be his "personal hole", and that he would text me every time he needed it. I don't know if this is a dream or a nightmare. On one hand, free dick, but on the other, he holds the power in my life now. One little thing can go wrong and he'd probably make my life a living hell.Oh god, what did I just get myself into?
