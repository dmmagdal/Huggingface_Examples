Chapter 8 -- Christina's AwakeningFriday, January 8thMy dad is in his bedroom on his back with two women on top of him. One is sitting on his face getting her pussy eaten, while the other bounces on his cock. I don't recognize the brunette with the giant boobs, but the blonde woman, who has her back to us, looks familiar. I think I know who she is, but it's difficult to believe I'm right. The women lean into each other and kiss while fondling each other's tits. The brunette's smile reveals how much she is enjoying herself.Since moving, Dad's had several women here, so it's not unusual for me to walk in and see him in mid-fuck, or to wake up to a naked woman emerging from the bathroom. At least, that's when he's home. I assume he stays at one of his girlfriend's places on the weekends because he rarely comes home before Sunday evening.The blonde lady slows her bouncing to a steady gyration and palms the brunette's tits, bringing one to her mouth to suck on the nipple. It doesn't remain in her mouth for more than a few seconds, though, because Dad grabs her hips and thrusts into her furiously.I slip behind Christina and put my arms around her waist as she stiffens. This must be a shock to her, seeing this."Do you want to leave?" I whisper.She shakes her head slightly and moans, "Uh-uh." Her breaths are shallow, and her eyes smolder with lust. "They left the door open while having sex?"I nod and answer softly in her ear, "Knowing them, they did it on purpose. They want us to see them."She presses into me as we continue to watch. My hands slide under her blouse to caress her stomach, and I work my way up to her boobs. Gently pulling on her nipples, I give her tits a long slow squeeze. When I lean down to lightly kiss her neck, she melts into my arms. One of my hands trails and cups her mound. Her hips thrust to meet my touch as she grinds her groin against my palm.The blonde rotates into reverse cowgirl and smiles as her eyes widen with mirth. She knows we're watching her. A Cheshire grin sprouts as she leans back into the other woman while rocking her hips. I'm right about who she is, and it shocks me.I whisper to Christina, "The blonde is Karen, my dad's old girlfriend.""She doesn't have any pubic hair!" Christina whispers."She likes to be clean-shaven because sex feels better that way."Karen and the brunette climb off my dad, and the brunette lies on her back. Karen gets on all fours over her and leans down to make out. My dad positions himself behind Karen and enters her. He slams his cock into Karen, making it difficult for her and the brunette to kiss, so the woman on the bottom slides down to suck on Karen's nipples. Then, he pulls out and slides into the other woman's pussy, causing her to moan at the unexpected pleasure. He alternates between cunts, sharing his cock between them.Christina's body quivers in arousal at the first threesome she's ever witnessed."Your dad is huge."I don't respond immediately so she can absorb the spectacle before our eyes. "You're shivering," I whisper in her ear."I'm so horny. I want to rip your clothes off and fuck.""Where do you want to go?""Your room. Now!"She grabs my hand and pulls me to my room, shutting the door behind us. We crash into each other, making out vigorously as I frantically unbutton her blouse. I pull my shirt over my head as she yanks my jeans down to my ankles. When she stands back up, I tear her blouse down her arms and dive in to take her nipple into my mouth. She gives my cock a tight squeeze, and I slide my fingers into her panties to try and finger her. Instead, we fall over, tangled in each other.Laughing, I finish removing my pants and then kneel to slip Christina's heels off. After tugging her pants down, I lightly trail kisses up her thigh until I reach her lace-covered pussy. Placing my mouth over her panties, I suck her nectar through the thin material. Between her juices and my saliva, her bottoms are soaked and practically see-through. Removing them, my tongue presses into the seam of her slick sex lips before I wrap my lips around her swollen clit, causing her to writhe in pleasure. She pushes my head away and scoots back on the bed. Crawling to her, I lean in and kiss her painted lips. The warmth from her slippery entrance teases my crown as it rests against her. I dip my cock inside and get ready to drive hard, but she puts her hand against my chest."Wait," she says."What?""Condom.""I thought you were on the pill.""I am, but it takes a while to become effective."My hot-blooded mind swirls, and my body doesn't want to stop. I have a hard time thinking. Remembering we didn't use all the condoms in my nightstand, I grab one and frantically tear it open before rolling it down my shaft. We aren't going to make love this time; we're going to fuck. I plunge into her with deep, intense thrusts. She plants her feet on the mattress and desperately hunches her hips to reach the right angle. Her eyes are half-lidded, and her mouth is open as she moans. I place my lips over hers, and her tongue shoots into my mouth. Our tongues wrestle while I continue to hammer her with fierce intensity. We grin at the effort it takes to keep our lips latched, so we abandon our kissing."Stop for a minute. I need a break," Christina pants.I pull out and sit back on my heels. There's sweat pouring off us as we catch our breaths."Okay, now fuck me until I come!" Christina demands.She raises her feet in the air, and I slap her swollen lips a few times with my cockhead before sliding back into her. Then, locking her legs in place with my arms, I lean forward and place my hands on each side of her head. I withdraw my shaft until my crown is just inside her and then drive my hips down.There's sweat on her forehead, and her brow furrows as she grunts, "Right there! Yes! It feels so fucking goo--FUCK!"I'm out of breath and huff, "I'm going to come.""To...geth...er," she pants.I slow my pace and release her legs from my grip. She wraps them behind my back and lifts her ass off the bed as she rocks her hips to match my rhythm. Then, she drops her legs and plants her feet firmly on the bed as she grabs my ass and pulls me into her. I speed back up when her muscles tense and the walls of her pussy squeeze my cock."Now!" she grunts.I push into her one last time, and my balls send waves of cum through my shaft. Her vaginal walls spasm as my pelvis rests against her clit. Finally, she relaxes, and I pull out, collapsing next to her.She grabs my hand. "Wow! That was good.""It sure was!"Removing the condom, I wrap it in a dirty sock. I'll throw it away later. We wait until our breathing returns to normal and then get dressed. Walking out of my room, Christina bumps into a naked Karen, who's leaving the bathroom. Karen gives Christina the once over before lightly placing her hands on my girlfriend's waist."So, you must be Christina. I've heard nice things about you."Christina blushes as she thanks her."I'll be back in about an hour," I shout to my dad, who's still in the bathroom."Take your time," he hollers back.As we drive off, I notice the redness in Christina's cheeks hasn't diminished."You okay?""Um...yeah. Karen kinda caught me off guard when I bumped into her...uhm...naked. She didn't even seem to notice.""I'm sure she didn't. If anything, she was probably disappointed you were dressed," I said with a slight grin.Christina is quiet for a moment before saying, "I came really hard tonight.""Me too. Watching my dad's threesome was one hell of a way to get worked up." I reply."True. My panties were soaked before you even got near them.""I loved tasting you through them."Her eyes twinkle. "I left them under your pillow."I barely contain my grin."How long till the pills kick in?""A whole week."We pull up to her place, and I lean in, kissing her deeply. I love the way she kisses me! My cock responds to her touch, so I pull away and run around the car to help her out."You are so beautiful; I have a hard time breathing when I'm around you," I murmur as I wrap her in a tight embrace."Okay, Romeo, you've already had your fun today. No need to butter me up." She whispers, lightly biting my ear. My cock responds with a twitch."I'm just telling you what's in my heart."I kiss her again, and she presses her hips into me as our tongues meet. My lust rises quickly, so I let go of her, and she looks at me with raised eyebrows."I have to stop, or I'll end up taking you right now.""Right here on the lawn? With my dad peeking out the window?"I stiffen and look around as Christina laughs.She grins and says, "I'm just messing with you. He's asleep...probably."I walk her to the door and take her in my arms again. I want her and can't get enough of her."Can I see you tomorrow?" I ask."I was planning on it.""What time?""How about I come over to your place? Will your dad be home?""I'm not sure, but since Karen was there and I didn't see her car, I think they'll be gone. And if he is, he probably won't be home until Sunday. How's ten sound?""That late?!"I laugh. "Nine?""That's better. I'll see you at nine."I kiss her again, and she goes inside. As I walk away, there's an emptiness inside me, like something is missing.Everyone is still in the apartment when I get home. "I thought you'd be gone by now.""We're just getting ready to go out. This is Joan," Dad says, introducing me to the brunette."Hey Joan, it's nice to meet you."Joan gives me a nod before continuing to get ready."Dad, Christina's coming over tomorrow. Is that okay?""Yeah, I won't be home until Sunday evening, though, so be good, and be careful.""She's on the pill, you know.""Just remember that they take time to kick in.""I know. I still have some condoms.""Good boy. Sleep well, and I'll see you in a couple of days."By the time I finish my shower, everyone's gone. It's quiet and lonely. I should've asked Christina to sleep here tonight: She could've told her parents she was at Nicole's or something.Walking into my room, I pull Christina's panties from under my pillow and inhale deeply. They're still damp and smell divine. Looking at my messy bed, I see scattered wet spots from where we had sex, so I decide to change the sheets. Falling into bed with Christina's panties clutched in my hand, I drift off to sleep. There's nothing like clean sheets, especially after a shower.Saturday, January 9thI wake up later than expected. After eating a quick breakfast, I throw on some shorts and collect some laundry. It's nice having a place where I can get most of our stuff washed at once. When I come out of the laundry room, Christina is in front of me, climbing the stairs. I must have slept later than I thought. Running up the stairs, two steps at a time, I catch up to her."Hey there, pretty girl."Turning around, Christina gives my hair an affectionate ruffle and asks, "What's with the hair? New style?""I slept in and lost track of time."We get inside, and I tell her to make herself at home. "We have the place to ourselves because my dad won't be home 'til tomorrow night," I say before going into the bathroom to clean up.Walking out, I freeze. Christina is sitting on the couch, with her feet perched on the coffee table. She's flipping through the pages of a Playboy magazine my dad has sitting out. She holds the magazine sideways to look at the centerfold and then notices me. She blushes and shows me the picture."Do you think she's pretty?" she asks."Not as pretty as you!" My cock gets semi-hard, seeing her sitting there. I take her hand and lift her to me, enveloping her in a warm embrace.My hands glide down to her ass and give her cheeks a squeeze and a tap. She presses into me, chasing my tongue as we kiss. Her fingernails rake down my cock, and I get fully hard when she tickles the area under my balls."I was hoping to find you naked when I got here," she teases."I didn't want any complaints from the neighbors while doing the laundry.""Who'd complain about that!?""You'd be surprised." I notice a grocery bag. "What'd you bring?""Some toiletries."My face brightens. "Are you staying for the weekend?""I wish. I want to try something, and I'm hoping you'll help.""Anything. What do you want me to do?""Well...," she pauses, blushing slightly. "After seeing Karen, and you telling me she shaves because it makes sex feel better, I thought I'd try it.""Mmmm...I must be doing something wrong!" I tease."You ass," she says as she slaps my arm. "I just want to try it.""I'm all in; what do I do?""I want you to shave me.""Really? I've never done that. I don't even know where to start," I say."You're a bright boy; you'll figure it out," she teases back. "Just be careful not to nick me.""Oh--that's comforting."She opens the bag and pulls out some scissors, hair clippers, a razor, shaving cream, and lotion."You came prepared.""I didn't know what you'd have." Then, while walking into the kitchen, she asks, "Do you have a large bowl for hot water?""Yep. Right here." I say as I take it from the cupboard,"Get some towels and a couple of washcloths while I fill this up."I grab some towels from the bathroom and strategically place them on the couch before Christina saunters in and sets the hot bowl of water on the coffee table.I pull her tight into my chest and kiss her gently while her fingers sift through my hair. Loosening my grip, I step back and remove her t-shirt. Reaching behind her, I fumble with her bra until the straps drop and it falls to the floor. Lifting her by the waist, she wraps her legs around my ass to hold herself against me, and I kiss the nape of her neck. Her nipples harden, surrounded by her tight pink areolas, and I take one into my mouth. She pulls my head into her bosom and moans before pushing me away."We're getting distracted," she whispers."I can't resist you."She smiles as I kneel before her to remove her jeans. Her delectable aroma betrays her, and she can't hide her excitement from me. My lust increases and I lean in to kiss her panties, but her palm against my forehead stops me. She hitches a thumb into the side of her satin covering with her other hand and drops them to the floor. She steps one foot out and then kicks them to the side with her other.My beautiful angel stands naked before me while I kneel before her. It's like I'm worshipping a goddess as I wrap my arms around her and press my cheek into her abdomen."C'mon, let's do this," she says.I stand, mesmerized by her swaying hips as she walks to the couch and sits on one of the towels. She puts her feet on the edge of the table, and I sit between her spread legs. I'm in awe of her beauty and lean in to kiss her flowering lips, but she puts her hand on my head and stops me."Focus.""Easy for you to say."I carefully trim her hair with the scissors before spreading her legs wider to get the outside of her labia."That should do it," I say.She runs her fingers around where I've trimmed and says, "Okay, wet the area with a washcloth."I place the bowl on a towel between my legs and dampen what's left of her pubic hair. She smiles and leans back as she closes her eyes."Enjoying this?""You don't know how much."It's hardly a secret, based on how much she's glistening. Spreading the shaving cream around, I carefully run the blade down her mound. After a few passes, I rinse it in the hot water and then stroke upwards. When I pull her labia to the side, it slips away, and she sighs. I get a firmer grip and pull it out again, and carefully shave her crease. After a few passes, she's nice and smooth, so I repeat my actions on the other side. Her pussy is very slippery now, and I'm tempted to dip my fingers into her, but I restrain myself.When I finish, she's smooth between her legs except for a small triangular strip of pubes. I take the washcloth, wipe away the remaining shaving cream and loose hairs, and then run my fingers over her soft skin. She places a hand where she's been shaved and notices the patch I left."I thought you were going to shave everything off?""No, I wanted to leave a landing strip."Kissing the inside of her knee, I slowly make my way up her thigh and into her newly shaved areas. She tangles her fingers in my hair and pulls me close, guiding my head with her hands. My lips form around her clit, sucking and flicking it, while two fingers are inside her, persistently teasing her g-spot. Her breathing shallows as she squirms and twitches until her whole body goes taught, and she lets out a long groan. Her liquid flows around my fingers, so I quickly latch my mouth to her hole and lap up her sweet nectar. She relaxes and catches her breath with a deep sigh."I take it you enjoyed that? Is it better smooth?""Wow! Yes! That was amazing.""Want to see how different it is with sex?"I stand up as she lies back on the couch, and I lean over to kiss her. Her tongue runs around the outside of my lips, tasting herself, and then she opens her mouth, and we kiss. I settle my cock over her entrance and slide into her dripping pussy. There's something different about the way she feels this time, besides having smooth lips. I realize why and quickly pull out of her."Be right back."She gives me a puzzled look as I run to the bathroom to get some condoms. I tear open a package and roll it down as I get back over her.Christina's eyes get big. "OH CRAP! Thank you!""Now...where were we?" I say as I slide back into her."Uhhh...that feels so good!"I drive home as she wraps her legs around me, pulling me against her. Keeping my pace measured to make this last, we get into a rhythm and slowly make love. Leaning down, our tongues meet again--"Go faster now," she begs."I'll come too soon."Her eyes lock onto mine. "I know. Go faster."I shudder and pick up the pace.She pulls me into her with her feet as I burst, far too soon. I churn my release into the rubber, and she smiles. Her feet relax, so I pull out and roll the condom off. When I sit back on my knees, she slides forward and takes my erection into her mouth. Her face tightens with a grimace."What's wrong," I ask."Condoms leave a weird taste. I can't wait to stop using them." She continues to suck on my cock regardless of the aftertaste.When she finishes, I put the towels and bowl on the table and sit next to her."That was nice," I say while holding her."Hmmm, it sure was."She sits upright with a jolt and says, "Didn't you have some chores you were taking care of?""My laundry! I need to get it out of the washers before someone complains.""I'll get dressed and help you. Do you have something comfortable I can borrow?" I give Christina a pair of drawstring shorts and then put mine back on. Relief floods over me when we learn that nobody disturbed my laundry, so we quickly move the clothes to the dryers before going back upstairs to clean up our mess.Christina has the towels in her arms and asks, "What should I do with these?""We'll wash them with some others."We grab all the used towels and take them downstairs. When we get back, I sigh. There are still chores I need to take care of."I need to finish cleaning up, but that can wait until after you leave.""You're kicking me out?" she teases. "I was planning on spending the day with you, assuming you want me to."
My heart leaps, and I kiss her. "I want to spend every moment I can with you.""Then let me help. And when we're done, I have another surprise.""Another one?!""Not until we're finished, mister. What do you need me to do?""I'll clean the bathroom and the kitchen if you vacuum?""Deal."We set about working, and Christina finishes before me; she even made my bed and straightened my room. She helps me fold the clean clothes and pulls both pairs of her panties from the warm mound."You washed them?""Of course. I was going to put them in my dresser in case you need a clean pair sometime."She places one pair in her bag and the other with the folded laundry. "I've never seen you in underwear before. Whose boxers are these?""They're mine. I don't wear them unless it's necessary."She helps me fold the sheets, and we put everything away. By that time, the towels are finished, and she helps with those too.We finish the chores, and she asks if I want my other surprise."I don't want another surprise. I want you."She kisses me and then reaches into her bag and pulls out a movie. I look at it and then look at her."A kissing movie? We just saw one last night.""I take it you haven't seen it then. I think you'll like it."She removes the movie from its sleeve and sticks it into the player while I turn on the television and pick up the jacket to see what it's about: Revenge, torture, and kidnap. Maybe this won't be so bad. We sit down and cuddle as the movie starts.When the show ends, I say, "That was fun. I liked it. Now, I need some food. We can either make something or go get something, your choice.""Let's go get something since we already cleaned the kitchen.""As you wish." We take a shower to get the smell of sex off us and make ourselves presentable before going out for some tacos. As we eat, Christina's fidgety."You okay?""I'm not used to being smooth downstairs. Everything is so much more...sensitive.""Is it a bad thing?""No. I just need to get used to it.""Maybe wearing a skirt for a while will help. Pants can get kind of snug.""Good idea."We finish eating and go back to my place to relax on the couch. Christina sits on my lap, and I nuzzle my face between her boobs as I hold her close."I don't want to leave," she says."That makes two of us. I don't want you to go.""I told my parents I wouldn't be out late because my aunt and uncle are coming over tomorrow."I take a deep breath and let it out. Her arms are around my neck as she tightens her grip, and I turn my head and let out another sigh, being content to stay the way I am. Finally, she releases me, stands up, and then pulls me up by the hand."Will you take me home?""No. You have to stay here."She puts her hands on her hips and gives me the look as I put my arms around her to hold her tight."Of course, I'll take you home. Speaking of which...how'd you get here?""Nicole dropped me off.""Did she know what you had planned?""No. I didn't tell her, in case I chickened out."We gather her things, and I drive her home. After turning the engine off, I lean over and kiss her. She has the sweetest lips."Want to come inside?""It's kinda late, isn't it?""No, it'll be fine, come on...come inside.""I thought we had to wait a week."She laughs, "Not me, dork. Inside the house.""Okay, but I need to tell you something first. I don't want you to freak out, but I have to get this off my chest.""What is it?"I take a deep breath and swallow hard, and Christina looks worried."I've fallen in love with you. I want you to know that my feelings for you are much deeper than just being friends."She smiles and lets out a sigh. "Well, that's good because I love you too, but I was afraid to tell you.""You can tell me anything. There's nothing you could do or say to tarnish how I feel about you."She leans over, and we kiss deeply. I sure love the way she kisses! We make out for another half hour before going inside.Mr. Taylor emerges from around the corner and says to Christina, "Well, you finally decided to come home. Did you have a good day?""Yeah. I hung out with Tom and helped him clean his apartment. After that, we watched a movie and then had some dinner."Mr. Taylor looks at me sternly and says, "Christina's not your maid!""I know, sir, it was her idea to help, and I really appreciated it. You have an incredible daughter. She's the best thing that's ever happened to me."His eyebrows rise as he glares at me. "Is she now?""Oh, stop it, Daddy, you're not going to frighten him off."Mr. Taylor smiles and says, in a somewhat defeated tone, "Okay then. Come on in. We're in the dining room discussing our menu for tomorrow."Christina whispers in my ear, "Let me put this stuff away, and I'll meet you in there."I follow Mr. Taylor to the dining room and see Christina's mom sitting there with some paper, a pencil, and a recipe book. She looks up, and I swear, it's like looking at an angel.Christina walks in and asks, "What's on the menu?"Her dad answers, "We're thinking of grilling some burgers for lunch, but we don't know what to do for dinner."It's awkward sitting here listening to them discuss their meal plans. Finally, Christina's mom looks at me and smiles. "Tom, what are you doing tomorrow?""Uh, except for some homework, nothing. I haven't really thought about it.""Would you like to come over?" she asks.Christina looks at me with a twinkle in her eye, "It'd be awesome if you did. You'd be able to meet my aunt and uncle."I look at Christina and then her parents. "Do I get another third degree?"Mr. Taylor chuckles, "No, that's my job. You'll probably have to answer some questions, though."I grin and say, "Well, that's understandable. What time should I be here?""Around one, if that works," Mrs. Taylor says."Can he come over earlier than that?" Christina asks.Her parents look at each other and then at me, and then Mr. Taylor replies, "Sure, if he wants to. Come over as early as you want, as long as you don't wake me up."Christina has that familiar look in her eyes and says, "Bring your books, and we can finish our homework together.""That sounds good. How about ten? Is that too early?" I ask."Ten'll be fine," her dad answers.I get up, and Christina walks me to the door. Looking around, we see we aren't being watched, so we embrace with a long kiss. I sneak my hand below her waist and give her cheek a pat as she reaches down and grasps my bulge."Take care of this for me."I grin. "As you wish."Sunday, January 10thI'm up early for a Sunday morning because I want to drop by the store and buy some flowers before going to the Taylors. I tell the clerk I'm not sure what to get, and she asks who they're for and what the occasion is. I explain they're for my girlfriend's mother, and a weird look comes over her face as she tells me how unusual it is and puts a bouquet together for me.I get to Christina's and knock. The knob rattles before the door opens. It's Christina, and her eyes brighten when she sees the flowers, so I give them to her with a kiss. The flowers were intended for her mother, but I wasn't about to tell her that. I'm going to have to think of something else to butter up her mom. Christina brings me into the kitchen, where I set my books onto the table while she searches for a vase.Mrs. Taylor puts her nose in the middle of the bouquet and says, "How nice, these are very pretty, and they smell lovely.""Aren't they awesome, Mom? I have the best boyfriend ever."Mr. Taylor walks around the corner. "What's all the ruckus about?"Christina's mom says, "Tom brought Christina some beautiful flowers, isn't that thoughtful? I wish someone would give me flowers sometime."Mr. Taylor gives me a look that's somewhere between worried and upset. This idea really backfired, but I shake it off and ask if there's anything I can help with.Mrs. Taylor gives a sweet smile and says, "You and Christina go finish your homework. We have it covered."Christina throws her head to the side as if to say, follow me, and spins around. I grab my books from the table and follow her up the stairs.The only thing I can focus on is her ass as it sways in the skirt she's wearing. It's mid-thigh length and flares out, so every time she takes a step, it flies to one side as if it's going to reveal her hidden treasures. Her swaying hips hypnotize me and puts me in a trance as my lust rises. Finally, we get to her room, and I drop my books on her desk as she shuts the door. She jumps into my arms, and we embrace tightly."I've missed you," I say before we lock lips."Since last night?""Yes. I had a dream about you.""A good one, I hope.""There isn't any other kind to have."Lifting the hem of her skirt, I give her soft cheeks a squeeze and notice she isn't wearing panties. Gliding my hand to her moist slit, I dampen my finger. She lowers my zipper to pull me out...but finds something in the way."You're wearing boxers?""Yep. I thought it appropriate seeing I'm meeting your relatives and spending the day with your family."She gives me a wiley look and says, "Maybe I should put some on too.""Boxers? Why don't I take mine off?" I tease.She buries her hands in my hair and pulls me into her. Our tongues dance as my hand drops to her smooth mound, and I probe her slit. My finger is coated with her nectar, so I slide it up to play with her clitoral hood, and she moans into my mouth. We hear footsteps down the hallway, so we break apart, and I quickly lick my fingers before zipping my pants up. Mr. Taylor pokes his head in the door."Keep the door open. You two may be adults, but you're in my house, and there'll be no hanky-panky on my watch." He leaves the door open and disappears just as quickly as he arrived. We take deep breaths, and I lean in to kiss her, but she puts her hands on my chest to stop me."We need to do some homework."Her desk is mahogany stained with three drawers on each end of the cubbyhole that's open on both sides. It's against the wall, and she asks me to help her move it so she can sit on one side and me on the other. There's a folding chair for me, so I place it opposite her and sit down before removing my shoes. My sock-covered foot searches out for her, but then I feel her toes climbing my shin until she finds my crotch and gives it a squeeze. I press her foot into me and groan as she smiles and opens her textbook."It's a good thing I don't have you in my study period," I say. "I'd never get any work done." She tries to pull her foot away, but I hold onto it and keep it right where it is. Christina gives me a sly look and smiles as we crack our books open.About an hour later, she closes her book, reaches across the desk, and takes my hand. "Do you think we can get into the same university?""I don't know. We've filled out the same applications, so I guess that depends on which school you want to go to and if I can afford it. I have some money saved up, but it probably won't get me past my first year.""Have you applied for any scholarships or aid?""A few, but I haven't heard back from them. I'll speak with a counselor tomorrow about it. Have you decided where you want to go?" I ask."Not exactly. My dad wants me to go to UCLA, so that's my first choice."Christina's beauty is irresistible. I can't hold back any longer, so I go to her side of the desk, lift her into my arms, and kiss her deeply. She wraps her legs around my waist as we frantically make out. Swiping our books and papers from one end of the desk, I set her down and press myself into her as if I'm trying to merge our bodies into one. My hard cock pushes against her, and I want to fuck her badly. Christina pulls her lips from mine with a gasp and throws her head back. I kiss her gently as my tongue travels from the base of her neck to her ear, where I nibble softly. She giggles a little too loudly, so I pull away from her."Shhh...we'll get caught," I whisper."I can't help it. It tickles."Christina embeds her fingers in my hair and guides me to her tits, where I kiss her softly over her shirt. Kneeling, I pull her ass to the edge of the desk as she parts her legs. Christina lies back and rests her legs on my shoulders as I kiss her thighs, working my way to the source of her addicting aroma.My tongue parts her labia where there's a trickle of juice seeping from the bottom of her pussy. I swipe it with my tongue. I get the hint when she grabs my hair again and tugs, so I lean in and devour her. Christina moans as I slide my finger inside her and continue to lap up her nectar. Her legs quiver, and juices flood my hand. Removing my finger and sealing my lips around her pussy, I drink her up. When I get as much as I can from her, I pull away and take a deep breath. Her delectable aroma fills my nostrils.Not wanting to increase our chance of getting caught, I stand and kiss her again. Christina pushes her tongue into my mouth and sucks my breath from me as we share this intimate moment together."Oh my God! I can't believe we just did that with my door open.""I can't resist you. You know that.""Let's get cleaned up and go downstairs. My parents are going to start wondering what we're doing up here."We go into her bathroom, where I wash my face, and she opens a new toothbrush, so I can freshen my mouth. When she begins to clean between her legs, I take the washcloth and do it for her. Next, I pick out some panties for her, and she slips them on as I slide my hand under her dress to grope her.She slaps my hand away. "Not now, you heard my dad.""It's going to be very...very...difficult to keep my hands off you.""Just pretend you're in church.""That'd be a first."We leave her bedroom, and she gives me a tour of their house. It's enormous with rooms everywhere. It's decorated elegantly, and everything looks pristine. There are two guest rooms, one connects to the other side of Christina's bathroom, and the other is across the wide hall. Her parent's room is at the end of the hallway and has double doors. All the rooms have floor-to-ceiling windows with breathtaking views.Downstairs there are two family rooms, one of them is formal, behind frosted double doors. The pantry off the kitchen is as big as my bedroom. We go to the backyard where her parents are, and she shows me the Jacuzzi, which seats at least a dozen people, and the pool has both a diving board and a slide.We stand there looking out over the pool, and my mind calms as I focus on the water's glassy surface. I'm holding Christina's hand, and she has her head leaning against my shoulder when Mr. Taylor walks up behind us and disturbs the peaceful moment."You look like you want to go for a swim," he says to me."It's one of my favorite things to do.""I'd think with the amount of time you spend in the water, you'd want to take a break.""When I lived with my mom, we had a small pool that I was in all the time. I'm like a fish out of water.""How are you doing in your swim meets?""We won't have our first one until late February. So we're just practicing for now.""Well, you don't want to get in this water; it's pretty cold because I don't heat it during the winter.""I didn't bring my Speedo with me anyway.""Speedo? You'll have to wear a different suit if you ever swim here.""It's the only suit I own, sir."He laughs and then changes the subject with a more serious tone. "You can call me Bob if you'd like.""Thank you, sir, uhhh..., Bob. That may take some getting used to. I've always been taught to call adults by Mr. or Mrs., and even though I'm an adult now, it feels strange to use first names."He nods, and there's a moment of silence before he changes the subject again."How tall are you?""About six-four.""I don't think so."I give him a puzzled look as he says, "I'm six-seven, and you're taller than six-four.""Well, it's been a while since I've been measured.""Just for the heck of it, let's see how tall you are."I follow him into the house, where he grabs a tape measure and has me stand in a doorway. He makes a mark on the door jamb at the top of my head, and I step away. He takes the tape measure and stretches it out. Wow...I grew two inches since last year.Mr. Taylor smiles and says, "That's what I thought, six-six. You seem to have a pretty good build on you too. Do you work out?""Three days a week, we work on our legs, backs, arms, and abs."Mr. Taylor nods again and then asks, "You said you had a job after school. What do you do?""I work at a grocery store. It pays enough to save for college and have a little for spending.""Saving for college? Your parents don't have a college fund for you?""No, sir. My dad said if I wanted to go to college, I'd have to take care of it myself. So I've been saving ever since I got my first job at fourteen." Should I tell him how Mom put half my check into savings instead of using it for bills? No, I think I'll leave my story the way it is."Have you thought about doing something else that'd help you earn more for college?""The work is simple enough that it doesn't detract from my studies, and the manager's been very flexible with my schedule. I don't want to work somewhere that'll make it more difficult to keep my grades up."The doorbell rings, and I'm instantly relieved that Mr. Taylor's focus will now be on someone else besides me. Christina pulls me into the entryway so she can introduce me to her aunt and uncle.The rest of the evening goes by without much excitement. It's nice being in a family setting where everyone seems to enjoy each other's company. It's getting late, so I tell the Taylors that I need to leave. I thank them for the great meals and let them know how much I enjoyed the evening. After grabbing my books, Christina walks me to the door."Everything okay?" she asks."It's great. I hope I didn't ruin anything by talking too much.""You were perfect. Want to know something?""What's that?""I love you!"There's no way to describe the warmth that fills my heart when I hear those words from her lips. It feels like the weight of the world's been lifted from my shoulders."I love you too. See you tomorrow?""I'd rather see you tonight and tomorrow," she whispers. Christina puts her arms around my neck, and I pull her into a long kiss. We gasp for air, and our noses are barely an inch apart as we gaze into each other. I finally give her one more hug and kiss before leaving.The drive home is lonely...like I've left my soul behind. The further I get from her house, the emptier and lonelier I am. When I walk into our apartment, Dad is on the couch, relaxing and watching television."What's up, sport? Where've you been?""Christina's family invited me to a get-together, so I've been there most of the day.""Do me a favor? Leave a note next time.""Uh...sure, Dad."He points at my books. "Get any homework done?""It's all done. It took a little longer than it should've, but it's done.""You're spending a lot of time with Christina lately. Is it getting serious?""Dad, I've fallen in love. I don't know when or how, but there's no doubt about it. I'm in love.""Love is overrated. You're still in high school and have a lot of years ahead of you.""Well, if it makes you feel any better...I'm in lust too."He laughs. "That I understand! How'd she take walking in on Karen, Joan, and I the other night?""I told her ahead of time that you'd probably be in the bedroom with a couple of women, but she thought you'd have the door shut. It was rather arousing. She pulled me into my bedroom because she couldn't keep it in her pants any longer. It wasn't a long night of sex, but it was awesome. I was the one that was shocked," I confess. "I didn't think you'd be with Karen."
"Yeah, we're seeing more of each other, and I've even stayed at her place a couple of nights.""I guess you guys ironed out the problem that broke you up?""I wouldn't say ironed it out as much as decided not to make an issue of it.""Well, I'm going to bed because I've been burning the candle at both ends lately.""Sleep well, and thank you for taking care of this place. It looks nice.""Christina helped me. She wanted to spend the day with me yesterday, and it was nice to have her around. Kinda like playing house, I guess."Dad gives me a sideways smile as I slough off to my room to get undressed and fall asleep.Monday, January 11thIt's lunchtime, and I'm sitting at our table wondering where Christina is. I look behind me, and she's prancing across the room with an extra spring in her step."Have you seen the banners in the hallway?" she asks."Can't say I noticed. What do they say?""The Winter Formal is next month.""The winter what?""Formal," she chides. "Where've you been for the last three and a half years...you've never been to a Winter Formal?""Uh, no. What is it? It sounds like it's going to be expensive.""Okay, the Winter Formal," she explains with that familiar twinkle in her eyes, "is where you rent a tux and a shiny pair of shoes, and I get a new dress. You then bring me to the school where we dance and socialize.""Dance AND socialize? Do you really know me at all?"Her eyes drill into me as she turns her bottom lip inside out to pout. Then, she drops her chin and says, "You don't want to take me dancing to have a good time with our friends?"I can't take that look, and she knows it. Dang it! How is it that she's so good at melting my heart?"I don't know how to dance, so I've never been to one. But if it means that much to you, I'll take you."Christina's twinkle comes back with a big grin, and we talk about our work schedules and the tests we have on Friday. She goes on to explain the colors we'll be wearing to the dance and that she wants to double with Nicole and Jim. She tells me that we'll go to dinner at the restaurant of my choosing, and then to the dance from there. I remind her that my car is only a small four-door, and I'm not sure everyone will fit, but she tells me she has that part covered."Awesome! Are we meeting in our usual place before your practice today?" She asks."Of course. I'll need your encouragement to get through the rest of my day without you."Our lunch ends, and we go to our classes. Jim is in my next period, and I see him just before going into the classroom, so I pull him to the side."Has Nicole said anything about where she wants to eat before the dance?" I ask."Dance? She hasn't said anything about a dance."Oops, I hope I didn't spoil anything. "Well, if you guys decide to go, let me know. I think Christina wants to double with you guys." The bell rings, and we sit down to listen to the boring lecture.After my last class, I drop by my locker to stash my books before heading over to see Christina. As I get close to her, my heart warms, and my chest swells. She's so beautiful. The way she stands waiting makes me feel like the most important person in the world. We embrace as I drop my hands down to her cheeks, and she pushes into me. The warmth of her tongue excites me as we duel. I pull out of our kiss and take a deep breath. I love the way she kisses me! We examine each other's eyes, and I tighten my grip to pull her closer to me. I tell her about my conversation with Jim and how he doesn't know Nicole wants to go to the dance."Don't worry," she explains, "he'll find out this afternoon."I kiss her again and say, "I'm really going to miss you this afternoon. We haven't been alone since Saturday.""That was only two days ago. Besides, you can see me after your workout today, just give me the key to your apartment, and I'll wait for you to come home."What a fantastic idea. I fish the key out of my pocket and hand it to her. I live within easy walking distance of the school, so I know she'll get there just fine."What are you going to do while I'm gone?""Homework."I give her another deep kiss and head on my way.Nothing significant happens during practice because it's a weight room day. The coach says he's going to start timing us and expects us to do well. I decide not to shower so that I can get home to Christina sooner.
