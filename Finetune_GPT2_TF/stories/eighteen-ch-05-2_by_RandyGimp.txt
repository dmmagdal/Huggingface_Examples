Chapter 5 -- Tom and the BeachSaturday, September 26thI can already tell that moving from the desert to the beach will be a culture shock. I didn't know there were so many people and cars in the world. It seems like we've been driving forever by the time Dad finally gets off the clogged freeway. I look around in wonderment because I've never been to the city before. I have my arm out the window, feeling the air get cooler as we drive further west.We come to a large apartment complex, and Dad turns right. Across from the apartments, there's a big park with lots of green grass, which seems alien to me. We don't have green grass in the desert...tumbleweeds, cactus, and dirt, sure...but no green grass.Dad pulls into the apartment's parking area, drives down a steep concrete ramp, and pulls into an assigned space under the building above us. He shows me where to put my bike and warns me to keep it locked, or it will get stolen. Grabbing my duffle bag and skateboard, I follow Dad up three flights of stairs until we reach the apartment.Dad tells me my room is straight back, and I have the bottom two drawers of the dresser and the bottom bunk. He also tells me I have some space to hang my shirts if I need to. There's nobody home as I survey my new surroundings.Walking in, the dining room is on my right and the living room to my left. There isn't much furniture in the living room, just a couch, a beanbag chair, a couple of end tables, with a small television against the wall. I get the impression the dining room isn't used much because there are only two chairs at the table. The kitchen is tiny, with only a refrigerator and a stove, and I can touch the walls opposite each other at the same time.Just before my bedroom, there's a small bathroom to the left. I walk into the bedroom, and the dresser and bunk beds are on my left. The closet is on my right. I open both drawers allotted to me and stuff my clothes in them before hanging up two shirts. George's skateboard is under the bed, so I slide mine under there, too, along with my empty duffle bag. I wonder if I've made the right decision, living with my dad. I tell myself that it's better than being under Rick's roof and that at least I'm not a hobo living in a rail yard.George walks in as I'm sitting on the edge of the mattress, contemplating my new life. I've met Karen but not George, so I stand and introduce myself. He's shorter than me by a good five inches and really thin."I'll get out of your way and find something to do," I tell him."No, man, it's cool. Want me to show you around the apartments?""Sure, that'd be great. Thanks."He kneels down, reaches under the bed, pulls our boards out, and hands me mine before we leave the apartment. I follow him around the large complex, where he shows me the best garages to skate in, and then we ride over to the pool."There's another pool, but we can't use that one. You have to be twenty-one, I guess because they allow drinking and stuff," George tells me.The pool area has kids running around the deck and splashing in the water. Their parents are seemingly off in their own world and not paying attention to them. It's not the most relaxing place, but if I need to get away, it'll work."Dude, wanna ride down to the pier?" George asks, interrupting my train of thought."Sure, how far is it?""About half a mile, but it's all downhill."I quickly figure out that my legs will get a good workout skating around on these hilly streets. We pick our boards up when we reach the pier because skating is not allowed on it. We walk around as George points out the best shops and things to do there.We get home a few hours later, and Dad tells us to clean up because we're going out for spaghetti. Before we all pile into Karen's small Volkswagen and drive down Pacific Coast Highway, I wash my face and hands. We walk into a small hole-in-wall that's dark inside, with airplanes hanging from the ceiling and a bar on the left. In the back, there's a bunch of tables and a couple of Foosball games...that's where we sit. Dad tells me this is a weekly tradition because they have a special where the spaghetti is only fifty cents. He also tells me that as a kid, he used to live about ten blocks north of where we were and that my grandma worked as a waitress down by the pier. I had no idea my dad lived down here as a kid because I'd only heard stories of his adventures living in downtown Los Angeles.Monday, September 28thIt's Monday morning and time for me to go to my new school. I'm nervous. Karen tells me that she'll meet me in the school office as George and I hop on our bikes, and he shows me the best way to get there. As I walk into the administration building, I suddenly remember that I forgot my paperwork. Karen strolls in a few minutes behind me and has everything in her hands, so we fill out the forms the counselor gives us, and she signs what's necessary before leaving. I'm sitting in the counselor's office, working out my schedule, and ask about getting into their water polo and swim programs. The counselor calls the coach and has him meet us in her office."Can I try out for the team, Coach?""No. My team is set, and even if I did, and you made it, by the time you learned our plays and adjusted, the season would be over.""Coach, can I at least swim in the pool after school?""No. That time is reserved for our practice and drills.""Can't we work something out?""Look, Tom, I'm not going to argue with you. After water polo, I'll hold tryouts for the swim team, but understand, my current team has priority. If you're better than any of them, then I'll think about letting you join, but for your sake, you better hope I don't. Typically, the only people I accept into the program are freshmen, and they start on the Junior Varsity team.""Why, Coach? Why won't you let me swim?""Tom, this is a tight-knit group. They've been swimming together since they started high school. If you replace one of them, you'll be the most unpopular person on this campus.""Coach, I'm not worried about being popular; I just want to swim. I've worked for three years so I can do this. I just want to swim.""Don't give me any more grief, or I won't let you try out at all."He walks away, leaving me feeling dejected. All the hard work I'd done to be able to swim my senior year was down the tubes. I'm determined to try out for the swim team, but my confidence in being accepted has been squashed like a bug. At least I can join the weight training class so my muscles won't fade away.I get home from school, frustrated by my day, to find Karen and George sitting in the beanbag chair, watching cartoons. I go into my room and change before going into the kitchen to fix a snack. Then, returning to the bedroom to study, I think how odd it is that an eighteen-year-old would sit around with his mom and watch cartoons, but to each their own.A few hours later, Dad comes home from work and goes into his room with Karen to have sex. They leave the door open. I look at George, and he just shrugs."There isn't much privacy or many secrets around here," he says to me."I guess not."George walks over to their doorway and stands there watching them, so I figure, why the hell not? I might as well learn something from this.Karen was wearing a tank top and shorts, but she's naked and on her knees, unbuckling my dad's pants by the time I get to the door. Dad has his shirt off, and he lifts Karen by the shoulders, and they kiss frantically. Then, he throws her onto the bed, where she lands on her back, with her legs in the air. Bending her knees, she plants her feet onto the mattress as she waits for my dad to finish undressing.Dad climbs onto the bed, gets between Karen's legs, and begins eating her pussy. He starts slow, licking her clit and then moving down to her hole. His tongue slides along her asshole, and she lifts her butt in response. Next, he slides a finger into her and pumps it slowly as his tongue invades her. He's not gentle at all. His face wags rapidly as his mouth holds onto Karen's pussy. She apparently likes it because she has him by the hair, holding his head tight against her. She lets out a loud moan as she raises her hips high into the air.Dad lets go of her with his mouth and gets on his knees between her legs. This is the first time I've seen my dad's dick, and it's a monster. He grabs his shaft and shakes it up and down, slapping Karen's pussy with his cockhead. She moans again, but this time, softly. She has her tits in her hands, massaging them and pushing them together. I hadn't noticed before, but her boobs are huge and firm, and I wonder if they're real.Dad slides his cock into her and pushes all the way to the hilt. Then, he pulls almost all the way back out before slamming his cock back into her. Karen flinches and groans. She leans her head back, looks at us in the doorway, and smiles. My dad slows and looks over at us as well."Tom, how would you like to get your cock sucked?" Karen asks.I look at George, and he shrugs. "Dude, it's your mom!""Wouldn't be the first time she's fucked one of my friends," he replies dryly.I look back at them and decide what the hell. I strip off my shorts and t-shirt, throwing them in our room before walking over to George's reclining mother. My cock is sticking straight out as I approach her. I slide my prick into Karen's mouth as my dad slams into her again. His rhythm is faster now, and each time he pushes into her, her mouth engulfs my shaft deeper. I rock my hips in time with my dad's rhythm and fuck Karen's face. She reaches up and grabs my rod and pulls it out of her mouth so she can lick and suck the tip while she's getting fucked. Engulfing my balls, she sucks on them as she pulls them away from my body. Her cheeks are severely indented, so I know she has some good suction going on."I'm going to come," I pant out."Do it, sweetie. Come in my mouth."Karen puts her lips around my cock again, and I drive it down her throat. She swallows as much cum as she can as I pump my cock into her mouth. After slowly pulling it out, she licks my shaft to get all the semen from it.Dad pulls out of Karen's pussy and strokes his cock until he comes too. His hot white spunk flies over Karen's head and hits my stomach. His second spurt hits her chin. His third her tits, and he works his way down until his last bit of cum dribbles out and onto her pussy.I looked over at George, stroking his hard cock that's sticking out of his gym shorts.Karen rolls over and licks the cum off of my stomach before crawling off the bed. Fuck, she's hot! She's the first woman I've ever seen that shaves all of her pubic hair. You can not only see her slit and swollen lips from the front, but her luscious pussy is visible as it pushes out between her tight butt cheeks. She wiggles her ass at Dad and me as she glances over her shoulder and turns the corner to the bathroom. I get hard again."I'm glad you joined us," Dad says as he walks by and smacks me on my back. His meat sways from side to side as he walks, and it makes me feel small. Turning around, I go into my room, pretending that what I just did was no big deal.Saturday, October 3rdGeorge and I are down at the pier, and he's showing me the kite shop. He talks about how kite fighting is the thing to do as we walk outside and see five kites in the sky. The guys flying them are trying to cut the others' strings."The last kite in the air wins.""How do they cut the string?" I ask."They have glass leaders."We're standing there watching when a girl comes up behind us and says hello to George. He introduces her to me as Lindsey. She tells me we have English together and starts telling me about the teacher and the class. One thing leads to another, and I ask if she wants to see a movie. We decide to meet at the theater since I don't have a car. After the movie, we walk to a stand to get burgers.While eating, she asks why I left my previous school. I explain the situation with my mom getting remarried, moving back east, and me moving in with my dad. We talk about all kinds of stuff, and then she asks if I know how to surf."Does body surfing count?"She laughs and says, "Dude, you've never been on a board before?""No. The only water we had was in pools. The beach is a couple hours away from there, so we didn't go that often.""Okay, desert rat, meet me down at the breakwater tomorrow morning at six. We're on dawn patrol, and tomorrow is supposed to be somewhat mellow."Sunday, October 4thI get up early, and George asks where I'm going. I tell him that Lindsey asked me to meet her at the breakwater, and he says to be careful, that the guys there are very territorial. I shrug, go downstairs, get on my bike, and head down to the water. It's still dark when I get there, but five guys are standing in a circle wearing wetsuits and stretching. I hop off my bike and walk over to them, looking for Lindsey. One of the guys sees me and breaks away, walking towards me."Hey rat, what're you doing here?" he asks."Lindsey told me to meet her here at six."One of the other guys hears this and says to his friend, "Dude, Lindsey said he's never surfed before, and she's going to show him how."He then turns to me and introduces himself as Marco, Lindsey's brother. "Lindsey said you'd be here this morning, but I didn't believe her." He puts his hand on his friend's shoulder and says, "Put it away, Diez."Diez has a knife in his hand, and the blade is out. Marco grabs a wetsuit that's on top of one of the boards and throws it at me, telling me to put it on. I stick a foot inside the leg, and they all start laughing."Man," Marco says, "don't be lame. Take your shorts off before putting the suit on."I take off my shorts when I'm interrupted again by Marco."C'mon, we don't want to see that stuff! Put a towel around you!" Marco says as he throws a beach towel at me.It takes some work, but I eventually squeeze myself into the suit, and just as I pull the zipper up, Lindsey walks over."Marco," she yells, "did you bring the longboard?""Yeah, I left it on the rack."Lindsey tells me to follow her, and we walk over to Marco's car, where she pulls a really long surfboard off the top rack. It's at least ten feet long."Tom," Lindsey says, "put the board under your arm like this and follow me."She holds the board in the middle, flat against her body, and then flips it out and hands it to me. I take the board and follow her back to the sand. She tells me to set it on the ground, fins down, and then turn around, so my back is to her. After I do all that, she pushes me, and I stumble forward."Figures you'd be a goofy foot," she says."A what?""Goofy foot. When I pushed you, you caught yourself with your right foot. So make sure when you pop up, that's the foot that goes in front."Pulling her t-shirt off first, she then drops her shorts to reveal a modest bikini. I hadn't noticed her fantastic body because of the way she dresses, and it's a good thing I'm wearing a tight wetsuit, or she'd see the bulge forming between my legs. She walks over to where the boards are and grabs a wetsuit, and squeezes into it. I'm mesmerized and no longer interested in learning to surf."Hey! Don't stand there staring at my tits; you're here to learn to surf. Now lie down on that board.""Uh, yeah...right."She teaches me how to paddle and get up on the board, explaining not to pop up until I catch the wave. She tells me the most important thing is not to snake a wave if someone else has already claimed it."I'm going to teach you how to turtle roll now.""Do what?""Turtle roll. It's where you roll with the board and go upside down, so the wave goes over the top of you. It'll help you get past the waves breaking close to the shore.""Okay. What do I do?""Take a deep breath and hold onto the sides of the board; they're called the rails. Then, push your toes against the tail and anchor the board against you as you roll onto your back."I do this, feeling stupid like she's playing some kind of trick on me."Once the wave is past, flip back around, so you're on top."I flip back around and then let go of the rails and relax my feet. She has me wrap the leash strap around my ankle and tells me to listen carefully to everything she says as we go out."Grab your stick and follow me," she says. "When you're paddling out, and you see the edge of the wave break, turtle about six feet before the curl hits the board's nose. When you come back up, paddle hard to the line. Once you're past the break, it'll get easier."The guys are already out, sitting on their boards, looking out into the ocean. As the sun rises, the sky takes on a bluish-black with red and orange hues off to the east. Wading into the water, I set the board down on the white foam. Putting my hand on top of the board, I hold it steady as it glides over the small waves. When the water gets around my thighs, I hop on and start to paddle.When I see the first wave come at me, I flip upside down, holding the rails tight, and feel the breaking water go past me before flipping back around. Once I'm back on top, I paddle hard and have to turtle roll two more times before I'm past the break. When I get out to where the guys are, they point to the south, telling me where to go. So I paddle in that direction and see movement out of the corner of my eye. It's Lindsey, and she passes me as she glides further out before sitting up on her board. I catch up to her, pull alongside, and sit up. I'm winded and breathing really hard while she sits there calmly."Sucking wind?" she asks. "Thought you'd be in better shape, considering your build. Take deep breaths and let them out slowly."We sit, bobbing in the water, as she teaches me how to watch the swell and what to look for in a potential wave. She explains how the line works and why the guys want me away from them. She tells me to respect them and the water, or get hurt, or worse, be a jake and hurt someone else.There's a good swell coming, so I turn my board, but Lindsey tells me to hold off because it's too big for me and to watch her. In one move, she swings her board around and drops down to her stomach. Her wet, straw-colored hair whips around and drapes down the middle of her back as she looks over her shoulder. Her hands are poised in the water, ready to dig hard, and just before the wave lifts her tail, she begins paddling. She takes about five strokes before setting her hands on top of her board and popping up. She stands on the board, relaxed, as she turns and rides the face of the wave until it dies out. The white foam gently curls around her tail as she drops off into the dark water. Then, grabbing the rails of her board, she hops back on and paddles out to me. I'm in awe of how easy she makes it look.The next good swell that comes, Lindsey tells me to go for it, so I turn and put my chest to the board and paddle hard. I feel the tail lift and accelerate. Planting my hands on the board, I push my body up and pull my legs under me. The nose of the board catches the water, and I pearl. I come out of the water, coughing and blowing the stinging saltwater out of my nose. I get back on the board and paddle to where Lindsey is and see her laughing hysterically. As I sit up, I see the guys pointing at me, also laughing. She tells me that I'm too far up and to scoot back next time.The next swell I jump, I make sure I'm further back. I plant my hands and swing my legs under me and stand up...straight, with both feet on the right side of the stringer. I promptly lose my balance and fall. It's like being in a washing machine, tumbling in the churning water. I come up, gasping for air, and recover my board to paddle back out--Lindsey's clapping and laughing at the same time.
"Nice header. You're not very observant, are you?" she asks. "Watch my brother and his friends over there. You'll see their knees are slightly bent and their upper body leaning forward a little; they don't stand straight up. Watch how they use their arms to balance themselves and remember, when you pop up, keep the arches of your feet in the middle of the board, over the stringer."I watch them and Lindsey for a while to see how they balance themselves and realize how close their movements are to riding a skateboard. Once I get that image in my head, I'm able to pop up and ride the wave in. We stay out for about three hours, and when we come back in, Marco walks over to me."You're great entertainment, funny as hell. Keep it up, though, and you'll get better." He gets a serious look on his face and continues, "You better not have peed in my suit 'cause if you did, I'll be pissed!""No, man, I didn't pee in your suit.""Good. Take it home and wash it out with fresh water. Get all the sand and salt out of it and hang it out to dry. You can use it until you get your own suit.""Thanks, Marco. I appreciate you helping me out like this.""Quimby, don't get all fresh on me. I'm only doing this solid for my sister. This doesn't make us friends, and don't think you can talk to any of us at school."Friday, October 9thAnother long week goes by, and school doesn't get any better. The only thing that makes life bearable is getting out in the water each morning to surf. Sitting on my board, watching the ocean rise and fall with each swell, waiting for the right wave to come along, is peaceful and calming.It's bizarre that Lindsey and her brother are willing to help me learn this sport, but they won't give me the time of day when we're at school. I even asked Lindsey out again, hoping that having her away from school and her peers would be different. But she told me flat-out that she wasn't going to date me."But what about surfing? You seem to enjoy being around me when we're out here, in the water.""Don't mistake what I'm doing here. I'm trying to help you fit in by teaching you to surf. I'm not doing this for the sake of enjoying your company. This is more of a community service than anything else.""A community service? Are you fucking kidding me?""No. Look, you don't fit in here. You're not from around here. One day, you may fit in, but that's a long way off. Learning to surf will help you understand our lifestyle. Until you do, you won't fit in, no matter how hard you try."Life at home isn't much better. The arguing is the worst part. Dad and Karen fight over the smallest things. It seems the only time they aren't at odds with each other is when they're having sex. If it weren't for George, I'd go crazy. At least he's someone I can talk to and skate with.Over the last week, Dad and Karen have had different couples join them in the bedroom, which caused me to have an almost perpetual hard-on. A few times, George and I got out of the apartment and went skating, just to get a break from it.When Dad gets home, he tells George and me they're throwing a party and that we should go find something to do. I go into my room to finish my homework and figure out where I'll go to make myself scarce. George has a date, which means I'll be flying solo. By the time I'm done with my school work, their friends begin to show up, so I pull my jeans on, grab my skateboard, and head for the front door. I'm walking by the couch when a woman grabs my hand and asks where I'm going."Down to the pier to grab a burger and hang out," I explain."Why don't you stay here with us?"I look at Dad, who frowns as he looks at Karen. She just shrugs. He looks back at me and nods, so I agree to stay. The woman looks familiar, but I can't place where I've seen her. She's got to be in her late twenties, tall, thin, and blonde, wearing a very loose-fitting blouse, unbuttoned about halfway down. She scoots over as I drop my board behind the couch and sit next to her. My eyes are drawn to her firm breasts and pebbled nipples. She plays with my ear and the back of my hair as the group carries on their conversation.She leans in close and whispers, "So, is it true? Like father, like son?"I look at her quizzically."Are you hung like your father?""No, I'm just average.""I'll be the judge of that," she says as she places her hand on my crotch.I look at Dad again, and he nods, but this time with a smile on his face. She kisses my neck as she unbuttons my shirt and then my jeans.When she discovers I'm going commando, she purrs, "Like father, like son."I glance around and see the others in the room watching with rapt attention. I decide two can play this game and slide my hand inside her top to fondle her. I kiss her neck and throat as I undo her blouse the rest of the way and then take her stiff nipple between my lips.She pulls my cock out and strokes me as she says, "Not like father, but nice."The others undress, so I slip off her blouse and skirt before removing my shirt and pants.She gets on the floor, and I crawl between her legs and place my hands just outside her shoulders. Leaning down, I kiss her neck and then her earlobe. I blow softly into her ear and then gently kiss her along her jawline before meeting her lips. She's not interested in kissing, so I nibble under her chin and the hollow of her throat. Next, I take her nipple into my mouth and pinch it between my lips before letting it go and licking it. My tongue travels around her areola and then down the center of her torso to her belly button.My next stop is the top of her clean-shaven pussy. She doesn't have an iota of hair, so my tongue glides smoothly along the insides of her folds. She raises her knees to her chest and presses her legs together, pinching her labia between her thighs. My tongue pushes into her slit as I alternately lick and suck. I lightly kiss her rosebud and let my tongue linger there before going back up to her pussy. She spreads her legs, opening up to me, so I dart my tongue into her moistening hole before pressing a finger into her cunt and curling it up to hit her g-spot. I slowly finger her as my lips surround her clit and play with it. My finger gets really wet, so I pull it out and put it in her mouth.Sitting on my haunches, I line my cock up with her pussy, and slap my cockhead against her lips. She flinches. Press my crown against her, my cock slides inside her warm, wet channel. Leaning forward with my hands planted next to her ears, I stare into her caramel brown eyes and rock my hips. She isn't that tight, so my cock slides into her easily. She clamps her hands behind my neck but doesn't pull me down, so I hover over her as my rhythm increases.We're breathing hard, and a bead of sweat drips off my chin onto her forehead. She lets go of me and wipes it away, so I take the chance to get on my knees for a better angle to fuck hard. She grabs her tits and pinches her nipples as her lips purse. Her brow furrows, she grunts, and I feel her come all over my cock. When I pull out of her, she sits up and engulfs my cock, giving me the best blowjob I've ever had."I'm going to come."She grabs my ass and pulls me into her, forcing my dick down her throat, and I come with a force I've never felt. My balls churn and wave after wave of hot spunk spurts down her throat. When I've finished, she pulls off me and licks me, balls to tip, until she has all the cum cleaned off.I sit back to catch my breath and look around. There's skin slapping, mouths slurping, guys and girls groaning, moaning, and grunting. I've never been in a real orgy before, and it's exhilarating. I wonder what would happen if I stuck my cock in that brunette's mouth?I turn around, heading for my target when Karen grabs my prick and pulls me towards her. She takes me in her mouth and gets me fully hard, and then turns around and tells me to fuck her doggy-style, so I grab her hips and thrust into her. There's cum and juices flowing out of her as I pump into her. It's a wet, sloppy mess, but it feels incredibly good. Her asshole pulses, so I drop a wad of spit on it and press my thumb against her star, which elicits a low moan.Removing my cock, I dip my fingers into her wet pussy to get some of her juices to lube her ass. I stick first one and then two fingers into her rosebud and then fuck her with them. Her hips buck against me, so I put the head of my cock against her asshole and press in. I pop into her, and she pushes against me, sinking my dick into her. I fuck her hard, and she loves it. She pushes against me just as hard as I'm jamming my cock into her."I'm going to come, Karen.""Come in my ass."I push in deep, and my balls release my spunk. The walls of her intestines clamp down around my cock and pulse. I slide out of her, utterly spent. She gets up and goes across the room and engages with another couple by sitting on a woman's face while she's being fucked. I lean back against the couch, cum dripping from my cock, exhausted. The first woman I fucked leans over and gives me a peck on the lips."Good job!""Thank you. This is a first for me.""Hopefully, it won't be your last.""Hopefully."She leans into me, and we make out. I didn't think she was interested in kissing, but as she jambs her tongue down my throat, I'm proven wrong. She takes a baby wipe and cleans my cock off, and then gets me hard again. She mounts me with her tits in my face and then spins around to the reverse cowgirl position and bounces on my cock. She expands my knowledge of kissing and pleasing a woman, adding that to what Candice taught me.I come three times with her and am worn out, so she moves on to someone else. I pick up my clothes and take a look at the tangled bodies on the floor and couch. Karen is sucking my dad's cock and getting pummeled from behind by some guy. I figure one of the reasons Dad left Mom is because she would never go for being a swinger and having orgies like this. I turn around and go into the bedroom.After everyone leaves and we clean up, Dad asks me if I knew who the blonde was."No. I didn't get her name.""You really don't know?""No."Dad picks up one of his porn magazines, opens it, and tosses it on the table. She's right there on the page, smack in the middle of a group having sex. A smile comes to my face as I hope to see her again.Friday, October 23rdI come home late from school, and when I walk in the door, I hear some grunting noises. My first thought is that Dad and Karen are at it again. In the last two weeks, I've had sex with Karen three times. One of them was a threesome with Dad and her. Karen loves cock, and she loves to have cum sprayed all over her. The other time, it was just her and me. She flat wore me out.I quietly shut the door behind me and walk to the doorway of Dad and Karen's room. I'm surprised when all I see is one of George's friends, Frank, fucking Karen. My mind flashes back to when Candice and I had sex and how awesome that was.I've gotten accustomed to going commando, and my cock was showing itself in the leg of my shorts as I watched them go at it.Karen looks up and waves me into the room. I walk in and strip down, and she pulls my cock into her mouth as Frank fucks her from behind. He gives me a strange look like I'm invading his space, but I just shrug and let Karen suck me off. My pelvis rocks in rhythm with his thrusts, which forces my cock down her throat. She pulls me out of her mouth and takes a deep breath."Boys, let's do something special.""What do you have in mind?" Frank asks."How about you both fuck my pussy at the same time.""Okay," he says."Get on your back, Frank," Karen instructs.He lies down, and Karen kneels over him, setting her pussy on his cock and dropping down. She bounces a few times while grunting and moaning. She leans forward, and they kiss, and I can see their tongues go at each other. She stops kissing him and leans up a little."Tom. Get on your knees behind me and fuck me from behind."She leans up a little as I inch forward on my knees. I set my cock at her entrance and push. It's a bit tight getting my dick into her hole while Frank is in there, but I push harder until I slide in.It feels odd, having my cock inside Karen's pussy, sliding against Frank's, but we get a rhythm going where I pull out, and he pushes in. The friction feels really good. After getting over the mental image of us touching and sliding against each other, I get to the point where I'm ready to come and announce it."Me too," Frank says."Both of you come at the same time if you can."Frank's cock pulses as it slides against mine, and it sets me off. He lets out a low grunting growl below us when he comes, and we fill Karen with hot spunk. Her pussy gets slippery and sloppy, with white goo spilling out of her. I pull out when she leans forward, and my prick just happens to be in the right place at the right time when she thrusts back down onto Frank. My crown penetrates her ass, and my dick goes almost all the way into her. She pulls forward and then thrusts back again when I push in hard.I'm fucking her ass while Frank's fucking her pussy. Neither one of us has softened after we came, and Karen takes advantage of it. We fuck her hard until we all come again, and then Karen flops on her side, breathing hard, with cum seeping out of her ass and pussy. I get up and take a shower while Frank lies there with her.Wednesday, November 25thIt's the day before Thanksgiving, and I've lived with Dad for almost two months now. Life at home and school hasn't changed. I was only included in one other party Dad and Karen threw. Most of the others I left before they got going, and I never saw that blonde again, much to my disappointment. Dad, Karen, and I have had sex more times than I can count. That's the only time I feel relaxed in the apartment. The rest of the time, I walk on eggshells because I can't take the chance of causing a problem or being the source of some unwanted commotion.More than once, I wondered if life with Mom would be better than living with Dad. When I first moved here, I thought that maybe, just maybe, Dad would open up to me and be interested in what I do. I was wrong. I guess I should be thankful that he let me move here and at least stay in Southern California.School's not fun either. I still don't have any friends and sit alone every day at lunch. Bored with my classes, my grades slip. I'm getting three B's, which I'm not happy about.I'm in the beanbag chair when Dad comes home. He and Karen almost immediately get into a huge fight, the loudest and longest yet, so I get up and go into my room. In the middle of it, Dad announces that he's finished with the relationship and that he's leaving. He storms into the room where George and I are doing homework and tells me to pack my things because we're moving. Besides all the sex we have, I can't say I'm sad about leaving and hope that living with Dad alone will be better. I pack my duffle bag and set it on the floor at the end of the bed before I crawl in the covers and fall asleep.Saturday, November 28thIt's five-thirty in the morning, and I'm in bed staring at the underside of George's mattress. Dad came home last night and told me to make sure all my things were together because we were leaving this morning. I didn't sleep well because I kept wondering what it's going to be like going to another high school; I don't even know where we are moving to. Looking at the clock, I decide to get out of bed and go down to the beach. I need to return Marco's wetsuit to him before leaving. I know I can't take long because, who knows, with the mood Dad's in, he might just leave me behind.I jump on my bike and hurry down to the breakwater and see the group about ready to go out. I remove my flip-flops and feel the cold sand seep between my toes as I yell out to them. Marco and Lindsey turn around to face me, so I run out to them, hand Marco his suit, and explain that I won't be around anymore."Put the suit in my car and the longboard on my rack before you leave," he says gruffly.I nod, and they turn around, shaking their heads as they walk away."What a loser," Diez says under his breath to Lindsey. She nods as they all get in the water.I pick up the longboard and look to the horizon, wanting badly to be out in the water. Thinking back on what I've learned from surfing: respecting the power of the ocean, the creatures living in it, and the balance and control I've gained, I'm grateful for this experience. Being able to paddle out and not be winded doesn't seem like much, but I think back on that first day and see how far I've come. I'm thankful that Lindsay, her brother, and his friends allowed me to be out with them. Even if they considered me a pariah on land, at least I was someone to them while in the water.I carry the board to Marco's car, fasten it with the bungee cords, so it's secure, and then get back on my bike. When I get back to the apartment, I go into the garage and secure my bike on the car rack. Then, I run up the stairs to get my things, only to find Dad in the front room."You ready to go?" he asks sourly."Yeah. Let me make my bed and grab my stuff."I go into the room, straighten the bed, and get my bag and skateboard. I look over my shoulder into the darkened apartment before closing the door and going down to the car.We're driving through downtown L.A. as Dad tells me he's rented an apartment in Burbank, which is a lot closer to his office, and that he'll have less traffic to deal with in the mornings. He gets off the freeway, and we go a couple blocks to a small white building. He tells me we have the apartment upstairs in the front, so we get out of the car and walk up the stairs to go inside.It's a small place but nice. I see the front room first, and it has a couch, chair, coffee, and end tables. Dad says he rented all the furniture except for the television and stereo equipment, which he had in storage because there wasn't room for it in the other apartment. The kitchen has a small round table made of dark stained solid wood, with two chairs. My room has a queen-size bed, and Dad's has a king. The dresser looks empty even after I put all my stuff away. Dad gives me a list of chores to do daily and a longer list to do on the weekends, telling me that it's my job to keep the place clean.Once we're settled, we go to the store to buy some food and then drive around to get our bearings on where things are.Monday, November 30thI wake up with dread in my stomach. We're only a couple blocks from the high school, but Dad drives me anyway. The situation seems all too familiar as he signs the necessary papers and then goes to work. I sit in the counselor's office, listening to her go on about the classes I need to take to graduate. Unfortunately, this school has different standards and requirements, and now I have to take a class with sophomores. The good news is, the rest of my classes are closer to what I started the year with. The bad news is, now I'm three months behind and will not only have to catch up but get passing grades to boot.I ask about the swimming program and if I can join it, but the counselor doesn't know if it's possible. The registration process ends. I'm given a locker and told to come back the next day. Getting my stuff, I walk the short couple of blocks home. I take a shortcut through the park as I think about my new classes and get knots in my stomach, wondering what tomorrow will bring when I start my first day in this new school.
