"Damn it!" Bernkastel huffs."Emily hates being in a mobile doll so perhaps there's still a chance we can reason with her dad," Alex says."I agree," Überstein nods."After that then what?! Huh?! I don't care about reasoning with them, I gonna fuckin kill them both!""Well exactly how are you going to do that, we're in their space factory?" Alex questions."It doesn't matter I'll figure something out, that bitch killed my grandpa! I already dealt with Captain Juan!""Leave him out of this! He did nothing wrong!""That bastard murdered my best friend and tried to take me out as well!""You're, you're wrong!""Oh spare me, Alex! I saw the reaction on your face, you were surprised when Überstein mentioned the Earth Republic using the Hunter Zaku! You had no knowledge of that, you like everybody else believe that lie! If Emily used her's it would have been orange.""You're wrong!"She rolls her eyes. "What did I ever see in you?""I'm not bad guy in this you cheated on me!""I ugh..." Bernkastel falls to her knees."Hey are you alright?" Überstein asks worriedly."Painkillers are wearing off.""Serves you right.""Quiet! Just lay down for now."****When dinner time came, Emily appears with a smile on her face and opens the cell door. Überstein helps Bernkastel to her feet. "She'll be given pain medicine.""I was right about what you needed to calm the fuck down even though it's disgusting.""Oh jealous that it wasn't you?" She smirks."Yeah like I would ever stick my dick in crazy."It wasn't long before they were in the dinning hall again and they took their seats and begin eating."So how do you like the food?""I must admit it's bit different from what I usually have but good nonetheless," Alex answers."What about the rest of you?""Will your dad be joining us?" Überstein asks."Nah he's handling some final preparations.""Emily, I know you don't like being inside the mobile doll, is there anyway you can reason with him?""Actually I have and there has been a change of plans."Both Alex and Bernkastel sigh in relief."I was thinking...""Lets enjoy the food and talk afterwards," she cuts him off."Ok."Once they finished they were presented with seconds. "Go on eat as much as you want."You poisoned our food haven't you!?" Bernkastel accuses."Oh for fuck's sake of course not. Why would I bother giving you pain medication?!""Oh yeah.""I was just treating you all to one last meal before we part ways.""So you're staying here?" Alex questions."Well duh! I have everything I need. Like my dad said, the 1st Post Apocalyptic War is pointless. I already fought one war so there's no need for me to be involved any further."Bernkastel bashes her fist on the table. "Remember what you told me when you were in prison?! You can't walk away from this!""Bernkastel please!" Überstein says."No! This bitch...""I'm glad we're on the same page," Emily chuckles. "Now let's finish our meal so we can finish our fight.""I guess it can't be helped," Überstein sighs.The two women eat as fast they can and then dessert is brought to them. "I demand seconds!""Bring it, she deserves to enjoy her last meal.""So what does your dad plan to do with the mobile dolls now that you've changed his mind?" Alex asks."You'll find out soon enough.""Too bad you won't be around to find out!" Bernkastel declares."Finish eating, Bimbo! You know it's a real shame that all that is going straight to your ass and breasts and not your brain.""At least I have an ass and breasts!""When you're dead I'll just cut off yours!"Once they were done they follow Emily.****The two women came out ready to face each other while the two men were escorted to the stand. "Welcome gentlemen.""Are you really alright with your daughter fighting to the death?" Alex asks."No I'm totally against it but she's an adult and I have total confidence in her."3 2 1 Fight!"Well come at me, Bimbo!" Bernkastel charges at her but is kicked in the chest. "You should have known I was going to counter that!" She approaches her but Bernkastel does a sweep low kick. "You should have known I was going to do that!" She proceeds to punch Emily several times.Emily punches back and throws her off. Bernkastel throws another punch but Emily blocks it and swiftly pulls Bernkastel to her and headbutts her. She kicks Bernkastel in the face and then grabs her blue black hair and punches her in the face and then stomach.She throws Bernkastel and approaches her and kicks her in the stomach.Überstein gets up, "I can't just sit here and watch this.""Überstein don't interfere in a battle between women," Bernkastel says proudly.Emily throws a kick but Bernkastel catches her foot and throws her down. Bernkastel struggles to her feet. "Ok orange bitch, round two." She approaches Emily but is knocked down again. Emily gets on top of Bernkastel and proceeds to punch but Bernkastel headbutts her and the two roll across the floor.Emily was on top choking the life out of Bernkastel. Überstein was about to get up again but then to the surprise of the men, several mannikins leap into the grounds and restrain both women."What?!" Mr. Ashby exclaims. "Deus, shut them down." The other mannikins came towards them."Um, something's wrong here," Alex says nervously."Deus, shut them down! Deus? Deus!""I'm sorry George but I can't do that, we had an agreement. An agreement that we would use the mobile dolls to save the rest of humanity not kill them.""What?!" Both Alex, Bernkastel and Überstein exclaim in unison."That's right, Emily had convinced George that humanity needed to be wiped out in order to protect their secret so she could finally have the one thing she always wanted."Emily grits her teeth."Deus how dare you betray us?""How dare you betray your fellow humans. I was created by humans and was programmed to protect humanity when I was installed in your motor vehicles. You were the one who betrayed your fellow humans by not fixing the flawed buses. I will preserve humanity with or without you.""Deus you would have been responsible for managing the new humanity!""No more war," Emily adds."This would be the third time, it already happened after the flood so there's no need for a third time, war is part of human instinct, you can't stop it.""If that's the case then how is it any different if we're in the mobile dolls?""Control," Bernkastel answers. "The AI knows it will be able to control all of the mobile dolls.""Only for a little while," Deus admits. "Your souls will still remain meaning your personalities will remain, meaning hubris will remain. I know this because the Elite came here looking for mobile doll bodies, they claim they were going to use them to end the war which they would but what do you they would have done afterwards? They were going to rule of over the human race as machine titans and I could not allow that. Once the ACORN system was used I made them destroy each other. I did that for the human race."There was silence."Take George and Emily Ashby away.""Deus, Deus you can't do this to me! Deus!" Mr. Ashby screams."Forgive them for what they've done.""So what now?" Alex asks."You three will be become mobile dolls.""Sorry but I don't wanna," Bernkastel says."I as well," Überstein adds."I'm fine with being human," Alex says."That decision is no longer yours to make. Look what has happened to the world.""You had all this time, why not use the mobile dolls to rebuild?" Bernkastel asks."There's no point if humans cannot dwell. With the body of the mobile doll you'll be able to survive in any environment, no more sickness only maintenance and if your mobile doll body brakes down you can be uploaded into another mobile doll body.""But I like my body just fine.""What are you going to do once the food and water resources run out? Mobile Dolls require no food."But surely it must have some sort of reactor that needs refueling.""You are correct but no need for food three times a day like you humans.""Yeah but they still need something to power them up and what happens if Nimrod shuts down?""There's backup power.""What happens if the backup power goes out?""I have mannikins to fix it.""What if the mannikins go out here?""Then the mannikins in Egypt will restore power.""What if they go out?""Then I'll turn them back on.""What if you go out?""I grow tired of your questions, young lady.""You're an AI you can't grow tired.""Enough!"The mannikins turn their guns pointed at them."You're either going to put us in the mobile dolls or kill us, make up your mind.""Hey you don't speak for me!" Alex snaps."Oh don't worry I won't kill you and I won't transfer your souls yet.""What are you planning?" Bernkastel asks."You will go back to your perspective factions and deliver them the message that I am prepared to make."I'm not going anywhere without my Royal Gundam.""Don't fret." A window opens and she sees it being repaired. "Also that fighter jet that was shot down is also being repaired. Once the repairs are complete you will take my message.""Do we have a choice?"****Earth, Grail April 4, 2099Gal kicks over a trashcan. "Damn it, motherfucker goddamn it!""Gal, calm down," Galen says."Shut up, just fuckin shut up! My Gundam is gone!" She exits the base and gets in the humvee. "Well are you going to drive me or what?!"The two men quickly get in and drive her to her parent's mansion, it was a quiet trip there. Once there Gal puts on her happy face. "We could be called back at anytime so keep your phone on and don't mention anything," Sean says sternly."Yeah, yeah I just found out about this new thing called plausible deniability," she rolls her eyes.Sean grits her teeth."Gal everything will be fine," Galen assures and places a hand on her shoulder."Take your expendable hand off!" She says and exits the humvee and it takes off. She knocks on the mansion door an a few seconds later her butler opens the door and greets her. "Ms. Alfredo, welcome back!""Glad to be back.""Sir Alfredo, Madam Alfredo, your 6th daughter is home!"Her parents appear. "Gal you're back!" Her dad exclaims happily. Her mother hugs her. "I was so worried!" "I take it this means we won?""No dad, the battle still rages on. Look outside." The three look up at Luna and see the yellow flashes."So you changed your mind and decided to come home?" Her mother asks hopefully."I'm sorry but that's not the case, I'm standby until further orders. You know the ship I was on the Sepulchre, well it's still up in space being repaired, it's unable to reenter the Earth Sphere so only a select few like myself was able to hitch a ride, I've been at the base since then, only this morning I was allowed to leave."Gal your sisters will be very pleased that you've, in fact they should be on their way here.""What?""Three of them are on spring break and your dad called a family meeting so all will be present and now that you're here it's perfect."Gal sighs and was soon eating breakfast."Better than those MIRs you eat.""That's MRE, and I have those only when I'm on missions, I eat regular food.""Yeah but that can't compare to your mother's home cooking."Gal gives her mother a perplexing look, the servants cooked, her mother didn't, in the eighteen years she'd been living the only food she ever received from her mother was breast milk. "Anyways I could be asked to return at anytime.""Well until that time, god knows I hope not, you will stay here.""I have a barrack I stay at.""Oh please, Gal your room is far better than some smelly old barrack!""Your mother is right, the barracks are full of undesirables.""Dad, those people are putting their lives on the line for you, for your freedom. And I'm one of them. I fought bravely." She exits the table."Where are you going?""To my room." Yeah like I was going to really stay in the barracks, luxury is all I know.She collapses on her bed. "I hope the Vice Chief is ok." She drifts on to sleep.Two hours later her mother wakes her up. "I want you to go to Albury's and get some items.""Yes Ma'am."A few minutes she was in the limousine being escorted to the store along with two servants. She hands the list to them and once they arrive they exit with Gal stepping out as well. "Ma'am you mean to enter in that outfit?" The driver questions."Yes, the Space Force is my profession. As I said, I could be called back at anytime."She enters the store and her servants hurry off to collect the items needed. Gal herself wonders around, she didn't need oversee them, if there was a problem they would simply call or text her."I wonder if they have those mini cherry pies." As she turns the next isle she bumps into someone and falls. "Ow.""I'm terribly sorry ma'am, Gal? Gal is that you?"She looks at the short brown hair blue eyed glasses wearing young man. "Roddrick!""Gal it's good to see you."She notices him and a few department managers. "Was I interrupting things?""No not at all, just doing some inspections. Since I bumped you down why don't treat to lunch later.""Um yes, you have my number, I'll be at my parent's mansion."****"So how is the family business going?" Gal asks."We're doing well, we're about to open another store in Eastern Iber." He takes a sip of his soda. "I must say you look very beautiful in your space force dress.""Thanks," she blushes."So how long will you stay?""I don't know, I'll probably be called back when the Sepulchre is repaired.""How was it so far? I mean the battle isn't over. We just have to look up at the moon.""It's dreadful but I held my own and...""And?""And I um shot down four Hunter Zakus.""Really?""Yep, they weren't that tough, probably could have shot down more in the Royal Gundam.""Congratulations Gal for becoming an ace in a day. And you also inherited the Royal Gundam.""Did. I did inherited the Gundam but it's gone now.""Well regardless I am proud of you Gal. Keep up the good work. So once the war is over, what do you plan to do?""I'll go to college.""Any idea which one?""Grail University for sure, the Vice Chief went there, all my sisters have gone, well three of are currently there so I might as well. No need to further complicate things, my family isn't fund of me joining the military as it is.""Well when this over they'll be proud, you're fighting for our independence.""See exactly, I can't just let everything and everyone I love be enslaved or destroyed.""Should I join.""No, we need you providing for us here.""What if things get really bad and they start drafting?""It won't come to that. The Gundam is gone so the Zoya have lost their greatest advantage. And once we take back Luna we..."We what?""Oh that's classified.""I understand. Oh and by the way I attend Grail University as well.""Oh yes that's right.""It would be great if we attended some classes together.""You really that would happen?""If not I can always give you some notes, even help you with your homework.""I'd like the very much."He smiles.her back to her mansion."It was great seeing you again Gal, we should hang out more while you're still here.""Gee I don't know, I could get redeployed tomorrow if not later tonight.""Well think about it, you have my number."She exits his car and once inside she finds her parents and sisters Lena, Violetta, Sofia, Regan and Pepper waiting for her."All my daughters are here once more!" Her mother says happily and sheds tears."Oh mom don't be so dramatic," Lena says."Well once you have children you'll understand, you need get started you're not getting any younger.""Mother!"The other sisters giggle."Enough of this, head to the front room!" Her dad says sternly.They all gather and her dad begins explaining the family business, and of course his oldest daughter Lena would be the successor, Gal rolls her eyes for none of it truly concerned her, all she had to do is not get into trouble that could result in a scandal thus jeopardizing the family name.After two grueling hours they were dismissed. "So Gal how was your lunch date?" Sofia asks."It wasn't a date, it was just Roddrick treating me after he bumped into me.""Oh please, he didn't have to do any of that, he totally has the hots for you.""Me? You're joking.""We have a class together.""Well why didn't he say anything before?""He probably doesn't want to rush in.""Don't be surprised if he confesses before you leave again," Violetta cuts in."Hey you two, don't be trying to corrupt Gal," Lena says sternly."We're not, we're trying to prepare her for Roddrick.""What about Roddrick?" Their dad comes in."Oh it's just that he likes Gal.""Really now?" He turns to Gal, "And what do you have to say about this?""I, I really don't know.""Well he's a good young man, good grades and even though he's not as rich as us his family is in the top ten so I will consider him. And while we're on the subject, how's the Vice Chief?""He's fine, just busy.""Good, Regan, Pepper come in here." The two sisters appear. One of you girls must get the Vice Chief, if you succeed our family will be even stronger for one day he will become Chief of State. So don't let him out of your sight, understood?""Understood!" The six answer in unison."Great!" Gal rolls her eyes.****Night comes and the sisters were preparing to go out. Gal looks up at the moon, the battle was still raging. "I should be ready to go but do they really need me, us? The Sepulchre is still undergoing repairs and my Templar is still up there. It'll be fine." She goes to change.An hour later all six were in the limousine. "So Gal you're finally part of the big girls!" Pepper cheers."So Gal, have you drank?" Regan asks."My flight instructor gave us a little for graduation and it was disgusting.""For many the first time is always disgusting but it'll get better.""I'm counting on it.""Speaking of first time, are you still a virgin?" Sofia asks."Yes I still am.""Oh.""What do you mean oh? I'm not gonna put out at the first dick I come across!""I bet you never even seen one.""Bitch are you trying to pick a fight? We're talking about highschool sex ed!""Any fool can see pictures, I'm talking about the real thing!""There's a lot more things to be concerned about than dicks.""Well we have to know, you're the youngest after all.""Well at least tell us are there any cute guys?" Regan asks.Gal notices that all eyes were on her even Lena the eldest. "Well sure, odds, evens, all in my favor.""You're closer to the Vice Chief than any of us so could snatch him up," Lena says."Yeah but what about Roddrick?" Violetta asks."What about him? Why settle for silver when you can go for gold!"Sofia, Regan and Pepper nods in unison. Gal sighs and looks out the window and sees the yellow flashing still going on.A half hour later they arrive at a club and Gal smiles as she presents her ID. A second later she's given a wristband. "What's this for?""It identifies you as an underage drinker," Pepper explains and holds up her wrist. "Only one more year left.""Can't we just get someone to serve us...you know?""And get kicked out, fined and jailed? No thank you! You know the drill!""Yeah, yeah, don't anything that will jeopardize the family name."
They find a table."Ok we'll be here for a few hours and then we go home, just eat, dance a little bit, no fights and getting drunk!" Lena barks."Oh come on none of us are driving!" Violetta pouts."Hey you can get drunk on your time but as long as you bare the Alfredo name you belong to dad!"Sofia rolls her eyes, "And the successorship has already gone to her head.""Sure hate to be working under her," Regan adds."She's our sister, the employees are lucky," Pepper corrects."I'm going to the bathroom," Gal announces and quickly exits."Oh Gal, bathroom is to the first right," Violetta says.****Gal sees the bathroom sign. "Yeah like I can't read." As she makes her way her phone suddenly vibrates. "Hope it's not high command telling me to come back. We did our job, it just that my Gundam got away. Damn you Bernkastel!" She makes the right and continues on. "I hope the Vice Chief is ok." She looks up and sees that the entire area was dark. "Huh? Did I take a wrong turn?" She turns around and bumps into a woman. "Oh excuse me. Um where's the bathroom?""First time?""Yes.""You were right there.""Thank you.""You look like you need to relieve some stress. Have a good time.""Um yeah," Gal says awkwardly as the woman leaves. "I don't have to go bad, maybe it's something to do with alcohol." She enters the bathroom and handles her business. She washes her hands, reaches for the paper towels and then notices a penis emerging from a hole. She gives a double take and stumbles to the floor. "What the hell?" She slowly gets up and exits the bathroom. She leans on the back of the bathroom door. "Why was there a penis in the bathroom? Why was there a penis in the bathroom?"She suddenly hears faint moaning. She gets down her knees and crawls closer to the sound and then she looks up and sees the woman from earlier completely nude and her mouth around a man's penis. Gal was perplexed. "She's actually having oral sex in public?" She makes out the man's right hand cupping the woman's ass. His other hand was cupping the woman's breast, she assumes.Gal was starting to feel hot all over. This was sex, what many of her friends actually talked about and actually done. Her sister Sofia asked her if she was still a virgin. She watches as the woman picks up speed with her mouth. The man's moans grew a bit louder. "I shouldn't be here and yet..." She witnesses the man smacks the woman's ass and she holds both hands over mouth.She watches as the woman removes from her mouth and spits on it. She licks the shaft and goes all the way down the his testicles and she mouths it again. "Wow it's big, and that thing goes inside of me in order to make babies. That's how I was...I wonder how does it taste?"The woman stops and then gets up and Gal watches as the penis disappears into her vagina. She could feel wetness emerging from between her legs. The woman was now riding the man. She could feel her heart beating faster and faster and then she shakes her head. "You got to get back Gal, you got to get back."She crawls away and eventually makes her way back to her sisters."Just in time to order," Lena says.Gal nods."You didn't get lost, did you?" Violetta asks sternly."Of course not." Bitch you knew it was my first time coming here and yet you acted like I've done something wrong.Time passes on and the sisters leave. "Did you have a good time, Gal?" Pepper asks."Um yeah we should definitely come back again." I should come back.****Nimrod Space Factory April 18, 2099"The repairs are complete and it's time for you to be on your way."Emily comes in with handcuffs. "Why is she here?!" Bernkastel demands."Because it would not be fair for you two to go back to the Zoya Remnant while he goes alone.""I don't want her with me!" Alex protests."That's not your decision to make.""What if I refuse to go?" A screen appears with a manikin preparing to shoot her dad. "Deus no! I'll do it, I'll do it!""Your ship has been equipped with the same type of booster as the Gundam, I've calculated the fastest route to Earth and it's just a week's journey.""Is the battle still going on at Luna?" Bernkastel asks."No it is over, Zoya is victorious.""Ha! Suck it, Alex!""Enough! Your war is pointless! You will deliver this message at great hast before they start fighting again! Emily your dad will be just fine.""Why can't he come with me? All this time I thought he was dead and now that I've found him I'm going to be separated from him again?!""You brought this on yourself.""Make him stay and my dad comes with me!""HELL NO!" Alex yells."He's right, it's his ship not yours or your dad's.""Enough of this nonsense! Let me kill them both!""Silence, young lady!""That bitch killed my grandpa!""I didn't kill him, I wanted to but I didn't.""LIAR!""ENOUGH OF YOUR PETTY SQUABBLES NOW GO!""Humph, one day Bimbo your luck will run out!"****An hour later the two set off. "Question," Alex radios."Yeah?" Bernkastel radios back."How come your Supreme Leader doesn't use his power? If that were me I would have crushed the Earth Republic in a day."Bernkastel ponders how to answer and looks to Überstein who shakes his head. "That's classified.""Fair enough I guess." He turns to Emily who was sulking. "Emily, Emily?""Just leave me alone.""Listen you'll see your dad again, ok?" She doesn't respond."I have a question for you Emily," Bernkastel radios."Yes what is it?""Where you born in a state called Alabama?""No why would...FUCK YOU, BERNKASTEL!""Well you and your dad...""Hey humans were doing that long before America! Egypt was doing it, you know Nimrod, which that factory was named after was the founder of Babel, and he had a sexual relationship with his mother Semiramis. Oh and let's not forget Adam, Eve and Cain.""Bitch that's not what happened! Adam and Eve had sons and daughters, Cain married his sister Awan.""See!""That doesn't count, it was only done to populate the Earth.""Well maybe other humans besides Adam and Eve should have been created on the same day.""There you go trying to justify your actions like murdering my grandpa.""I thought I already told you that I didn't murder him. Now I'm ending this conversation!""Humph, stupid orange bitch!" Bernkastel looks at the radar, the space factory Nimrod was getting further and further away. "So Überstein, why doesn't the Supreme Leader uses his Newtype powers? He seems almost godlike.""He's not, he can still get sick and...he almost died during the civil war. You've seen his memories, you've seen the madness he's been through. Imagine if more people knew. What would that be like?"She has a grim look on her face, "I wouldn't want anyone to go through the horrors he went through.""Exactly.""But is that really the only way.""You're the Newtype.""I...let's just drop it for now."The hours pass and both put their machines on autopilot. Alex eats dinner, he offers Emily a MRE but she refuses and was still sulking. "You not eating won't help your dad one bit.""Leave me alone."He sighs. Another hour passes and he looks back and sees her asleep. For a moment he was mesmerized by her sleeping form, she looks gentle and cute but he quickly shakes it off remembering that she's a monster in human form. Two more hours passes and he drifts on to sleep.****Earth, GrailGal and her bodyguards were driving to Albury to get some medicine, her entire family was under self lockdown due to the outcome of the Battle of Luna. They exit the humvee and witness some people fighting each other over food, the police appear and break it up."What are you all doing?! You're supposed to be protecting us!" A man screams."Unbuckle your hoister, things could get rough," Sean whispers. They enter the store. "Just get the medication and we're out.""What is the Chief of State doing!?" A woman screams at Gal."Excuse me, who do you think you are?!"Galen restrains her."The situation is under control, she's preparing a counterattack as we speak," Sean lies. "Please remain calm." The woman darts pass him. He turns to Gal, "You need to calm down.""She had no right!""She only did it because she's scared like everyone else.""Oh and I'm not!?""Of course we all are but its our job not to be.""Let's hurry and go," Galen says.Gal quickly heads to the pharmaceutical department and her eyes meet with Roddrick's. "Why are you here?""School is open but none of my instructors are present so I came here to try and keep order.""I came for my mother's medicine. This is madness.""This could be the end.""Hey we won't let them reach Earth, we have an orbital defense fleet ready.""Are you going up there?""Um." Damn it, I don't wanna go up there. Maybe I should transfer to Army but the Gundam! Wait what am I saying? The Gundam is gone! What do I do, this could be the end! Suddenly more fighting breaks out and Sean appears. "Gal we have to go now, a possible riot might occur so we must be prepared." She grabs to the medication."Wait Gal, there's something I have to tell you," Roddrick says.Gal places some money in his hands, "I have to go."He sighs, "Later then?"Gal doesn't respond.****The cameras flash as the Chief of State Glendarah Kits approaches the podium. "My fellow Earth Republicans, it is true that we lost a great many soldiers and the battle as a whole but we're not out, we're currently working hard to boost our defenses. Sure things may look bleak and I must confess that our Vice Chief of State is currently missing in action but he wouldn't want us wane in our faith, his mother would tell us the same thing, we must remain strong, there is a light at the end of this dark tunnel and we will see it together but only if we hold fast together! Only together can we overcome the Zoya menace, let us not fight amongst ourselves but fight against the Zoya together!"The people slowly clap.****Evening came and there was no riot but morale was still very low. Gal went home but it was her last night for the next day she and others would be conducting training exercises and she didn't know when she would return.All her family did was watch the news and occasionally they would cry and then the parents would tell them how much they loved them and then go through the photo albums. It became too much for Gal. "I'm going out.""What where?" Her mother demands."Anywhere but here, this is depressing.""Gal you're supposed to be with family," her dad says."Yeah but you're supposed to be encouraging me, boosting my morale. You all heard the speech by the Chief of State." The rest of the family was silent. "I'll be back in a few hours."As she should stood waiting, she goes through her phone and sees two missed calls from Roddrick. She sighs, he wasn't a bad man it just she wasn't sure about her feelings. Her bodyguards came and she enters the humvee and they drive off."So where to?" Sean asks.She tells them about the club she went to. "Gal are you sure about this?" Galen asks."Hey you guys are supposed to be on my side!""Just making sure.""I'm going to have some fun before all that rigorous training tomorrow. And you two expendables are going to make sure I have a good time tonight or I'll make sure the both of you spend the rest your lives diving through sewage on one coin per day! Do you understand?!"They both grit their teeth and reply yes ma'am."Alright what are you waiting for?! Drive goddamn it like you did it yesterday!"They reach the club and Gal eats and drinks and orders seconds and thirds while her bodyguards pay for it all."This is good, now if only I could drink some wine. Ok you two, purchase some alcohol but smuggle it out.""Are you being serious?" Galen asks."Do you not recall what I said if I didn't have a good time tonight?" Galen was silent. "I'm heading to the bathroom now."As she reaches the intersection she stops, "To the right is the normal bathroom but the second right is...Do I dare? I mean watching that was...pretty hot. This was exact reason why I decided to come here, I could have gone anywhere else. Do I dare? You only live once besides every other girl does it, or at least...I bet Bernkastel was...with Alex." Her mind drifts to Roddrick. "I wonder how his looks like." She goes straight until she makes the second right and she reaches a door. She gulps and opens it and it was dark like the last time but she doesn't see anyone.She reaches the bathroom and on the door it says vacant. "Good." She enters and handles her business. She scrolls on her phone for "instructions" and blushes, afterwards she washes her and waits for a minute and then a penis appears. "Do I dare? Damn it Gal just get it over with!"She approaches the penis, gets down on her knees and taps the tip with her right finger. "Can't believe I'm doing this." She grips the shaft and starts going forward and backwards slowly. "I can feel the veins." A few seconds later she switches to her left hand. "This isn't so bad." She slowly picks up speed."Don't go so fast bitch!" a voice barks. Gal gulps and complies. Her right finger taps the tip again and she tickles it. "Your mouth, I want to feel your mouth!" Gal was stunned, "My mouth?!" She decides to use both hands and increases speed. "No!" The man growls and tries to pull out but Gal refuses to let go and she continues wanking and then suddenly he explodes his cum on her military dress. She was horrified. "Bitch!""That's what you get for being rude!" Gal wipes the cum off her uniform and then second penis which longer than the first. "I guess I should." She gets beside the penis and begins wanking it. She could here a moan. "Such a nice soft hand you have," the new voice says which made Gal smile. She takes her time with this one, switching hands. "Oh, may I feel your lips?" Gal was stunned again. "Again with the mouth? Well I suppose, that is one of the ways. And he did ask politely unlike that first man." She obliges by kissing the tip and then puts lips on the shaft from top to bottom. Honestly she couldn't believe she was doing this, kissing a stranger's penis."I need to finish quickly, surely Sean and Galen must be getting worried." She wanks him faster with both hands while kissing and she sees precum oozing out. There was no way she was going to get that stuff on her military uniform again. A minute later the man groans and his cum came spewing out and Gal was stunned upon seeing the first load the wall with such speed and force. She looks back and watches the white goo ooze out on the floor. "Can you clean it?" Gal hesitates but grabs some paper towels and wipe the stranger's cock clean. "I was hoping you could use your tongue." Gal stops and a few minutes pass. "Are you still there?" When no answer came the penis disappears.Gal breaths a sigh of relief. "Glad that's over. I should get going." Suddenly her stomach starts hurting so she sits on toilet. "Maybe I ate something wrong." A few minutes pass and she feels better. She gets up and washes her hands again and then she looks and sees two of them emerging. "Oh hell no, I need to leave." She looks back for a second. "What's wrong with me? I can't seriously think about doing it again! But this was literally the sole purpose of my coming here! But my bodyguards.""What are you waiting for? The bathroom door makes a loud noise so I know you're still there," a familiar voice grumbled.Gal was frozen in place. It was her bodyguard Sean and that means the other penis was..."Sean, don't take your frustration out on her.""You're right I apologize.""I can't believe my own bodyguards! I do it quickly and then I'm done." She gets back on her knees and grips both cocks and begins wanking them.""Just give us a quickie," Galen says which made Gal smile."Speak for yourself! I'm going to take my time with this, we barely get R&R as it is.""But Alfredo...""Fuck that bitch!"Gal was angry and grips his cock harder."Ow, not so hard!""I want you to put my meat in your mouth, please," Galen requests. She begins kisses it. "I would like to feel your warm wet tongue on my meat." She starts licking it."Hey I am not getting any action over here!" Sean snaps.She resumes wanking him and then she taps it lightly and smacks it."Ow, why did you do that?!""Maybe she thinks you're into kinky stuff?" Galen laughs.Gal resumes wanking Sean and she starts to pick up speed."No stop rushing it!" Sean growls."Come on, we really need to get back," Galen suggests."And I already told you I'm taking my time. That purple haired bitch has been gone a long time so why should I have to worry, it's bad enough we have the split bill for her food! Honestly I joined in order to serve the Earth Republic not babysitting a damn brat!"Gal was beyond pissed she and opens her mouth in order bite his cock but at the last second his cock splashes into her mouth. She starts coughing and gagging. "Oh god that tasted foul!""Gal!" Both Galen and Sean exclaim in unison.Upon realizing that she spoke, Gal covers her mouth with both hands. Her phone suddenly goes off, sweat starts popping out as she slowly turns her head and sees it was Galen calling. They knew the familiar ringtone."Gal what the fuck?!" Sean screams.No words came. She sees the cocks disappear. "Please don't tell my parents!" She finally finds the strength to get to her feet. She starts banging on the wall. "Please!" When no answer came she stumbles and lands on the toilet and begins weeping.An hour later she comes out of the bathroom and makes her way back only to discover an empty table with a bill. She pays and exits the club. She ponders what to do, what could she do, they were going to tell her parents and she would be disowned by them.She calls both phones again but they don't pickup. "Damn it don't do this to me!" She chews on her thumb. "What to do, what to do?" She stares at her phone. She could call her family and mistake her bodyguards for robbers so they could get killed. No that wouldn't work because they wouldn't have left the club without her. She could tell her parents herself of what she done, perhaps they would forgive her. That idea would be the last resort. Her heart sank even further for she knew what she had to do.She texts both of them. "Can we please talk about this?" There's no response and she feels her sidearm. She could always do that and hide the bodies. She could write a note stating that both Sean and Gelen has forcing her that way she could take them both down. It would look like self defense. The police would believe her, she had her family and favor of the Chief of State, she could get Roddrick on her side real easy, he was crazy about her so yes it would work. "Good bye Gelen, good bye Sean." But the cameras, surely the club had cameras, she clearly saw the normal restroom but decided to go straight and take the next right into the other room and she been in there for an hour or two. Long before them. She could have easily told the Vice Chief, Captain Amoco or the Chief of State. "Shit!" She finds a bench far from any eyes and begins weeping more but then her phone rings. She looks at the ID, it was Sean. "Hello?"Sean: "It's not my policy to watch a woman cry but you deserve it."Gal: "Wait you guys can see me?"Sean: "Well duh! You wanted to talk so start talking."Gal: "I... I'm sorry okay, I'm sorry for the way I've treated you both! Please don't tell my parents?"Sean: "Tell your parents what?"Gal: "You know?"Sean: "Say it! Say it clearly."
Gal: "That I've gave hand jobs to strange men..." He hangs up. Gal's eyes widen in horror and she calls him back but there was no answer so she calls Galen.Galen: "Yes Gal."Gal: "Please I'm sorry!"Galen: "That's not good enough Gal."Gal: "Please I promise to be nicer to you both." He hangs up on her. "Fuck!" She starts thinking and texts them. "I'm willing to negotiate!" Sean's phone rings.Sean: "So what do you have in mind?"Gal: "I'm willing to finish what I started."Sean: "What?"Gal: "I will give you both a handjob!"Sean: "I'm not interested. You're gonna have to do better than that!"Gal: "Fine I'll perform felatio or whatever you want!"Sean: "Do you get an allowance from your parents or just what the military pays you?"Gal: "Both, how much you want?"Sean: "Two thousand a week for the both of us!"Gal: "Two thousand is that it? I'll get my parents..."Sean: "We don't want their money we want your money!"Gal: "Fine whatever!"Sean: "You best sweeten your tone, Alfredo."Gal: "Ok, ok let's get this over with so I can go home."Sean: "Stay where you are, we're coming to you."Ten minutes later the humvee appears and Gal transfers two thousand into Sean's account and two thousand into Galen's account. "Ok done now take me home!" They drive until the reach a secluded area. "Hey what is this?""A bit of roleplay," Sean answers in a computerized voice. "You wanted the Royal Gundam after all. I'm Raijin.""And I'm Fujin. During this roleplay you will not speak unless we give you permission, you will do exactly what we tell you, understood?"Gal rolls her eyes."Well?" Raijin asks."Well what?""Well they're not going to unzip themselves."Gal gets down on her knees and unzips Fujin and Raijin's pants. She pulls down both boxers. "Can't believe I'm doing this." She wraps her hands around both cocks and start wanking them off."Smile at us," Raijin commands.Gal does it."Oh ah, you have nice soft hands," Fujin moans.Gal begins pumping faster and begins alternating between kissing and licking the tips and the shafts. She was feeling very hot but wasn't sure if it was due to the guilt or arousal or both."I want you to lick my balls," Fujin commands.Gal lifts Fujin's cock and places her tongue on the right ball."Oh yes Gal!"She kisses it and then goes for the left."Okay Gal start the felatio." Gal inhales and then exhales. Fujin watches in awe as Gal opens her mouth and engulfs his cock. She slowly begins bobbing her head back and forward."Okay my turn," Raijin says after a few minutes had passed. She begins and does her best but after three minutes he stops her. "I can you tell you never sucked cock before.""How long have you been doing this?" Fujin asks."Tonight was my first night.""I see. Well you can practice on me."Gal resumes sucking him off."I've seen better," Raijin huffs.Gal glares at him. "Uh-oh Raijin, I think you've gone and upset Gal. Are you going to take that from him or are you going to show him what a great cocksucker you can be?!"Gal releases Fujin's cock. "I'll show you!" She puts it back in her mouth and bobs her head faster. Fujin groans."Your hand is slowing down Gal," Raijin grumbles."Raijin, I think you should let her finish me off first, she's not at the level where she take the two of us together.""Very well Fujin, after all I did cum but you didn't so fair is fair."Gal releases Raijin's cock and now turns her full attention to Funji. She increases speed and then releases his cock from her mouth as she feel the disgusting salty precum go down her throat."Come on don't stop with your mouth.""Ok, ok just let me know when you're about to cum." Given the choice she'd rather the seed be on her than in her. Perhaps she could avoid it all together, let it spill out on the ground. She gives the head another licking and kisses the shaft and balls before putting the cock back in her mouth."Raijin, you should...ugh, oh...give...her, ah a chance.""Nah."This infuriated Gal, she uses both hands while still having Fujin's cock in her mouth but she takes it out as more and more of his precum came forward down her throat. Raijin sees the reaction of disgust on her face as she swallowed the seed."See, she can lick and kiss but I have no desire for amateur blowjobs."Gal decides to ignore Raijin and resume sucking, she already made up in her mind of what she would do. "Ohhhh," Fujin groans as he feels her tongue twirling and she squeezes his balls. "Look at me," he commands. Gal slows down for a minute and then picks up speed. "Oh god this is!" He feels his balls tense up and he explodes cum in Gal's mouth before she had a chance to pull it out and had no choice but to let the thick salted cream go down her throat. He pulls his cock out of her mouth and while she's coughing he grabs her short purple hair with his left hand and wanks ferociously. Gal knew what was coming and a few seconds later his cock explodes more cum all over her face and hair. She screams as some of it lands in her eyes and she instantly closes her eyes and Fujin sighs happily."Open your eyes," Raijin barks and grips the part of her hair that wasn't covered in cum. "You're such a naughty woman, Gal and naughty women get punished." He rubs his cock against her face and proceeds to smack her. She yelps. Smack, smack, smack, smack, smack! Three on the right cheek and three on the left. "Tell me you enjoyed it.""I enjoyed it.""Honestly Gal, this is a better look for you, I think you should consider switching professions," Fujin mocks."Look away unless you more cock." Raijin pulls up his boxers and pants. "Ok let's get you home."Gal breaths a sigh of relief.They reach her mansion, Gal had gotten the cum off her face but her eyes were red due to it getting in her eyes. The only explanation she had is she'd been crying due to the defeat of Luna, as for her cum covered hair she would have conceal it under her service cap and take a shower as quickly as possible. As for the cum stains on her uniform, food stains she would explain and put it in the laundry.As she exits the humvee she glares at them. "You two are hypocrites! You both wanna crucify me for the gloryhole but who was getting their dicks wet, huh? Get some girlfriends!""You misunderstand Gal, you're an 18 year old woman exploring her sexuality which is perfectly normal and something we don't give a damn about, this was about the lack respect you give us! That's the reason we did what we did!" Sean explains.Gal grits her teeth, "Well you had your fun but it's over, no more!""Gal we're not interested in your body, only your money and your respect for us! What part of that do you not understand?!" Galen adds.Gal slams the door leaving the two baffled for a minute. As she takes out her house key, she receives two text messages from her bodyguards. The first one was the first phone call from Sean when she was on the bench and from Galen the most damning piece evidence against her was the roleplay, her eyes widen in horror, how could she have been so stupid? It was shot from his POV, the masks, computerized voice and fake names, no one would have known it was them, only thing seen was a purple whore. She looks back at the humvee driving off and puts her head down in defeat."So how long do you think we can keep this up?" Galen asks."I say at least until we're done being her bodyguards.""That probably will be at end of the war. It might be a long war.""We'll be very rich men then, hehe."****Luna April 25, 2099"Sir we've detected two incoming objects!" A communications officer reports.The office in charge comes in. "What do you have?""One of them is a fighter, resembling the Earth Republic model and the second one is...It's a mobile suit! It's our Gundam!""What?!""Yes its ours!"The Dudael Fleet was alerted."Why is the Gundam and that Earth Republic craft flying together?" Admiral Terrence ponders."Sir we're receiving the ID code from the pilot Ensign Bernkastel Wheat, she requesting that we let the Pterosaur Interceptor pass.""Pterosaur Interceptor? That's what its called?""She says it's a matter of preservation of humanity?"Admiral Terrence and the Supreme Leader glance at each other."Sir?""I cannot read her mind from this distance, but I trust that she has a good reason."Admiral Terrence was perplexed."Tell her the request is granted. Tell all personnel not to fire at the Earth Republic interceptor. Let it pass.""Sir are you sure about this?" Admiral Terrence asks.He nods.****"Well this is it, we're here," Bernkastel says happily. "Alex they've granted you permission to pass.""Thank...thank you," he says regretfully.She watches him leave and for a moment she has grim look on her face. "God damn it, why did it have to be this way. To think you didn't know anything about it but you made your choice and so did I."The Royal Gundam lands and there's a crowd of people gathered. The chest opens up and Bernkastel floats down first followed by Überstein. The people cheer and among them was Meghan. "You made it, you're actually still alive!" She hugs Bernkastel. "Um yeah," she says awkwardly.The Supreme Leader, Lady Helga and Admiral Terrence step forward to meet them and both Bernkastel and Überstein salute. "As you were. Great job staying alive. Get cleaned up, get some food and then see me for debriefing.""Sir, with all do respect I think debriefing should be held right now.""Wheat!" Admiral Terrence exclaims."Now, now, I'll allow it, both of you Überstein come with me."****The Pterosaur Interceptor approaches the Celestial fleet of fifty ships. Once the two were on board the lead ship, they shower, put on flesh clothes and then escorted to Earth.They meet with Chief Kits. "Welcome back, as you can imagine with the defeat we've suffered our people have become quite concerned which is me putting it mildly.""I'm afraid we have nothing to brighten your day save more bad news," the Vice Chief says."You two surviving and the briefcase has given me some brightness.""So the contents are safe?""Indeed. I had Captain Amoco deliver it to me personally. So what's the bad news?""Well first Bernkastel is alive and has possession of the Royal Gundam and has returned to the Zoya Remnant." Chief glares at Agent Orange who looks away. "Second, we have a new enemy." They tell her about the Deus but makes no mention of George Ashby. He plays the message."Greetings humans of the Earth Republic and Zoya Remnant, I am an artificial intelligence known as Deus, the once beautiful Earth has been devastated by World War 3 but is in the process of healing. However, your 1st Post Apocalyptic War has threatened to undermine the healing process and will surly speed up the inevitable conclusion of human extinction. This can be avoided by submitting yourselves to the mobile dolls. These machines will become your new bodies. How is this done you ask? Presenting the ACORN (Artificial Control Object Remote Neuron) system. By overloading it, the human soul will transfer inside the body of the machine thus saving you all from extinction. Once inside you all can survive the environment and rebuild. The Earth can be restored, I await your reply.""And what if I refuse to become a mobile doll?""I think we can expect a hostile takeover, they are armed and we were shot down by one and the Royal Gundam took down at least six of them.""So I assume he has enough mobile doll bodies for us all.""Yes Ma'am and not just us but the Zoya Remnant as well."The Chief cups her chin, "Hmmm, open a channel to Luna."****LunaThe Chief of State appears on the main screen and a few minutes later the Supreme Leader, Lady Helga, Überstein, Admiral Terrence and Bernkastel appear in the control room. "Greetings Supreme Leader of Zoya." Bernkastel balls her hand into a fist upon seeing her."Have you come to negotiate?""Hardly, I was wondering if you got the message from Deus?""Yes, and we're rejecting his offer.""I plan to do the same, seeing that this is a clear and present danger I believe a truce is in order.""A truce you say?""Yes, we should assume that the enemy's numbers far exceeds both our forces, and it may be necessary for us to form an alliance. This is about the human race surviving in its organic bodies.""A truce I agree with but alliance with you I disagree with.""Very well, I request you treat all POWs with dignity.""Very well then." He studies her for a second and his body tenses up and Lady Helga notices this."Until we meet again." The screen fades to black.****Earth, Grail"Honestly, that man's telepathy makes me sick!""Was it really wise to call a truce?" Vice Chief Bonaparte asks."There's no need to fight a tiger at the front and a wolf in the back.""Do you think they will honor it?""I hope so, that's only reason I considered an alliance.""Yes I could see he was taken aback by that.""We will send a reply to Deus.""I'll deliver the message to the media ASAP.""No, not yet.""But Ma'am the people need to know what is coming.""And they will but not now, their morale is low, what do you think this will do?""What can we do?""I'm working to fix that," she glances at Agent Orange. "You've survived, your mother would be proud." Tears start flowing from his eyes and Agent Orange shakes her head. "Leave everything to me. Go get some rest.""Very well I'll leave it to you."She pats him on the shoulder and once he was gone she approaches Agent Orange and slaps her. "We could have had the Royal Gundam and Bernkastel dead but you had to go and ignore orders! Do you want to live here?!"At that moment Agent Orange's dad flashes in her mind. "Yes I want to live here.""Then I suggest you knock off the cowgirl bullshit! One more strike is all you get! You are to report to me at my estate tomorrow at 10, don't be late!""Yes Ma'am."****Luna"So are we going honor the truce?" Lady Helga asks."Yes at least for now." He turns to the communications officer. "Broadcast the message. ""Yes sir.""We should launch an attack," Lady Helga suggests."No, I don't want the Earth Republic attacking us while we're split. Überstein come with me.""Yes Sir.""Wheat, you're dismissed.""Yes, yes Sir."The two make their way to the office that once belonged to Admiral Vargas. "Take a seat." Once Überstein sat down the Supreme Leader give him stern look. "I honestly can't believe you of all people would do something so reckless.""Forgive me Sir but I had to know the truth. I had to know if she was truly on our side.""Oh? Is my telepathy not good enough?""Well Sir since she already knew about it she could have countered it. We both know that intelligent agencies like the CIA and KGB of old were very much into mind control, and since the Earth Republic descended from the Earth Coalition it would have made sense for them try something like that."So what do you think? Is she truly on our side?""Yes Sir, I can guarantee you that she is.""That Gundam is a one seater, so she sat in your lap the entire time?""Yes Sir.""Überstein you sly dog.""Sir I..."The Supreme Leader reads his mind and smiles, "You made love to her.""Sir, she actually made love to me.""There's no difference, well your voice is slightly different than what it use to be.""Sir I assure you that I only acted out the interest of the Zoya Remnant and what she and I did didn't affect my decision.""I'm sure it didn't but you disappoint me, I ordered you to live but you were to planning to kill yourself. If it wasn't for wheat you would have been dead. You're one of my most trusted friends. I need your assistance.""Forgive me Sir.""You are forgiven now go get some rest."****Überstein makes his way to the Luna base infirmary, when he gets there he greets Sergeant Major Selena. "Good see you alive and well.""Likewise, I honestly didn't believe it when I heard. You even brought the Gundam and its pilot back.""It's all thanks to you getting me there. I'm going to recommend to the Supreme Leader that you be promoted."Sergeant Major Selena smiles, "You're alright Überstein, you're alright.""I can't make any promises but I will try."She nods. "Doctor says that I should be out in another three days.""That's great, I'll see you soon."She nods again, "Thank you Überstein."****The shuttle carrying both Bernkastel and Überstein made its way to The Ultimate. Once it lands the two disembark. "Well um we made it," Überstein says monotonously with a hint of awkwardness."Yes."There was nothing but silence as the two stare at each other. Suddenly talking and footsteps could be heard. "Well I guess I'll see you soon.""Yeah.""Oh ho, what was that?" Meghan asks coming behind her."Meghan, you were on the shuttle as well?""I have to see Captain Vance.""Magnolia was promoted?""Well of course, she was second in command.""Oh yeah." Bernkastel has a grim look on her face."Well I'll see you in a bit."Bernkastel reaches her room. "Welcome home Bernkastel, welcome home!""Haro! Haro I missed you so much!" He flies into her arms and glances at the picture of her, Adriana and Lorenzo and holds him tight while shedding tears. "From now on I'll take you everywhere with me."****"Welcome back Sir!" Überstein's subordinates say and salute upon meeting him."How's everything been in my absence?""Good Sir."He nods goes into his room. "For a moment I didn't think I would see this place again." There was a knock on the door and he answers it. For a moment his eyes grew wide for it was Captain Brax but the image fades. "Data specks Sir," his a subordinate answers "Oh yes, you are dismissed." The subordinate salutes him and he salutes back and shuts the door. "Well Captain I'm back, only this time I didn't watch, I actually got my hands dirty. Captain, Bernkastel made me a man." He sighs and reaches for a bottle of scotch. "I understand now Captain, it's a pity that we won't get that double date."****It was late in the afternoon Earth time when Meghan shows up at Bernkastel's place. "Captain Vance has called a meeting, all Alpha Shrikes are required to attend.""Ok on my way.""So, you and Überstein were together for a lone time, anything happen?"Bernkastel sighs, "I made him a man."Meghan squeals like a little girl."What its no big deal, nothing that hasn't been done on the pleasure deck.""But this is Überstein, Zam Überstein, whose doesn't smile, speaks monotonously and uncomfortable to be around.""He's not that bad once you get to know him.""Oh you know him alright."Bernkastel rolls her eyes."So are you two in a relationship?""Oh heavens no, it was a just moment that was well needed. I certainly don't see myself in relationship with him or really anyone else for the time being, we're at war and the much larger threat is coming.""Well if you need to relieve some stress you know where the pleasure deck is.""Oh course but I really don't think I'll be going up there anytime soon. I'm just...""You're still thinking about your ex?""No not really, I did encounter him though, piece of shit! I just need to focus on improving my skills.""The pleasure deck is for improving your skills.""No not those skills!""Well anyway I think both are essential."They enter the briefing room. "Ok let's get started, starting tomorrow we'll be conducting combat drills in preparations for this new threat. I don't have to tell you to be ready for anything and everything."
An hour later the briefing is done. As they were preparing to leave Bernkastel stops Captain Vance and smiles. "I'm glad to see you alive and well.""I wish I could say the same about you. A great battle was won but not by you! Brax died because of you!" She slaps Bernkastel. Everyone was stunned."Some Newtype you are!" Lieutenant Commander Abigail screams."We used all of our strength to win," Commander Holly adds."While your worthless ass got captured!""If you're a so called Newtype then why couldn't you save Captain Brax?!" Tsukiyomi screams."But the Supreme Leader is a Newtype.""He's old and has a different type of power! You should know that, bitch!""Stop this, you're all acting like children," Meghan says softly."Shut up, Lamb!" Captain Vance screams. "I'm going to recommend that you be removed from the Alpha Shrikes, we're perfectly capable of fighting this war on our own! I'm not gambling my life on you!"Bernkastel leaves. "Wait!" Meghan stares at them in sadness. "How could you do that? And the rest of you did nothing!""Why Bernkastel why not Brax?!" Captain Vance cries and the others go to comfort her completely ignoring Meghan.****Bernkastel enters her room and bashes her fist against the wall."Bernkastel angry! Why Bernkastel angry?!""No matter how hard I tried its just not good enough. It's not that I'm looking for recognition, it's just they could be a little god damn grateful! Not even Lady Helga acknowledged me and I even gave up moral conviction.""What will Bernkastel do?""I..."There was a knock. "Bernkastel? Bernkastel?""Go away, Meghan!""But...""GO AWAY!" A second later after Meghan had left Bernkastel collapses on the bed. "Maybe they're right, Captain Brax is dead because of me. Maybe I deserve all the hate especially by Magnolia.""Bernkastel its war, something Bernkastel can't control.""I know Haro but still, sigh."****Nimrod Space Factory"Well George, it seems both parties have rejected my offer." He doesn't respond. "It seems they must be discipline."George Ashby lifts up his head. "Deus please, my daughter is down there!""If your daughter truly has the devil's luck she'll be fine."****Earth, Grail Military HeadquartersAgent Orange was in her room pondering her next move when the intercom calls for her to gate 1. "Man what now?!"As she makes her way, Commander Barcelona glares at her, "Can't believe that bitch is still alive!"She arrives at gate 1 and was perplexed to see the Vice Chief's car. "Get in we have to talk.""Yes Sir," she salutes and rolls her eyes.They set off and didn't speak at all. Agent Orange gazes at the sunset, "Daddy." He hears her murmur but focuses on driving. An hour he stops the car and both of them exit."This empty house belonged to Laplace and Dorris Bonaparte, my dad and mom. It is now mine but I have yet to set foot in it. I most likely won't until after the 1st Post Apocalyptic War." He unholsters his gun and points it at Agent Orange."Ah this is where you plan to do it, fitting."For a moment his mind starts thinking about what Bernkastel had said. "Did you kill my mother?!""Why are you asking that question?""Answer the question! Did you or did you not kill my mother?!""And if I said no would you believe me? Could you honestly believe someone whose hands are soaked in the of blood the innocent? Someone who has the names of both you and your mom on her kill list? If you wanna shoot me then go ahead! Life ain't gonna get better!"He grits his teeth and for a moment he could see her real face fair but full of despair. He struggles for a minute but puts the gun down. "You really didn't kill my mother but if you didn't who did?""I could help for a price.""What do you want?""I want to rescue my dad.""Hold on you were the one who asked me to keep your dad's existence a secret.""Well now that Deus' offer has been rejected its only a matter of time before..." She turns her head away. "What if...it's too...late." She sniffles and removes her shades and wipes her eyes.""I'll talk the Chief of State into lending me an HLV to negotiate with Deus in person tomorrow.""Tomorrow?! This needs to be done now!""Rushing won't accomplish anything. We'll need fuel, food and...""I just need a quick trip going back and forth! Don't be wasting my time!""Wasting time? You're right why I am wasting time on you?! You and your dad desire the destruction of humanity so fuck you!" He starts to walk away but stops. "I should just kill her for that but unfortunately we need all the help we can get repelling Deus, and she was Marius so I definitely can't leave her unchecked. Damn it." He sighs, "Fine I'll help but it will take sometime.""Thank...you.""You're welcome Emily.""Do you not see the orange shades? That's Agent Echo Orange.""I wish you would find an identity and stick with it!"****The crowd cheers and the camera lights flash, Echo finds it annoying because it reminds her of the past, the name Agent Echo Orange was going to be known throughout the Earth Republic. This was all part of the Chief of State's plan to boost morale. It was officially known that the Vice Chief returned alive and she protected him.The narrative was that while pursuing the Royal Gundam it had fired a shot that caused the Pterosaur Interceptor go down in the Earth Sphere rather than the insubordination of Agent Orange."With your permission, I would like say something to our people.""Ok but say nothing about the mobile dolls."Alex nods and steps up the podium. "My fellow Earth Republicans, it is good to be back, all the time I was struck in the wasteland my mind was on one thing, getting back here, getting back to you the people. I am fortunate, however the same can not be said for many of our valiant men and women in uniform who have perished, we may have lost the battle but we will win the war. Let us honor those who have given their lives to keep us all safe, let us do it for them and the future generations of the Earth Republic. Freedom is our right, let it not be taken for granted!"The people start clapping and cheering.An hour later Chief Kits, Vice Chief Bonaparte, the rest counsel and other rich and powerful members were at the Earth Republic Palace for the Vice Chief's homecoming party."Welcome back Sir," Captain Amoco says."Thank you, how's everyone else doing?""We're doing fine, Sepulchre's repairs are nearly complete.""Good.""So the Gundam?""Unfortunately it still functions and so does my ex.""I see.""We'll have to come up with a new plan. We'll talk later." A few minutes later he spots Echo by herself looking out window yet again and goes over to her. "Why can't you socialize?""What is the point, you know what's coming. Speaking of that, what has the Chief said about me going to the space factory?""I have not said anything yet."She grits her teeth."Calm down I'll get on it as soon as I'm done here have patience."Gal and her bodyguards come over to join them."Hey Gal, how was training?""Brutal, I would have slept in but got the call from Chief herself.""Well I'm glad you're doing good, you haven't gotten to any fights, right? Ensign Galen, Ensign Sean you guys been keeping her out of trouble?""Of course," Sean smiles and Gal forces a smile of her own."Good, she's like a sister to me."Gal's smile fades when he says that."So Gal, about the Gundam..."Agent Orange was to leave but then a staff member appears, "Excuse me Agent Echo Orange, Spacemen Gal Alfredo, the Chief would like a word with the two of you." They both nod and follow him.A minute later the Vice Chief's friends Ben and Katrine appear. "Enjoying your party so far?" Ben asks."Yeah but it was totally not need it, there's much to be done.""Are you sure you're up to it?" Katrine asks worriedly."I have to be, I'm the Vice Chief after all.""We'll make sure you don't push yourself too hard.""Yes of course.""So?" Ben asks."Yes?""That blond was with you the entire time, right?""Yes.""Anything we should know about?""No nothing, in fact she's quite crazy."****The women enter the Chief's office and salute. "Both of you sit." She looks at them for a moment and then speaks, "The Battle of Luna was costly in lives, equipment and morality. The speeches the Vice and I gave aren't enough, they were similar but he just said whatever came to mind, there was no preparation there.""So what exactly do you want from us?" Agent Orange asks."I want you two to become poster girls."Gal smiles."What?!" Agent Orange exclaims."Yes, we need replacements for Bernkastel Wheat and Adriana Rin. You protected the Vice Chief and you Gal, you're a rich girl who became an ace in a day."Gal's smile fades. "Um did Roddrick tell you that?""Yes, he and his dad had an appointment with me and during our talk I merely wish we had something boost morale and here you are. You shouldn't have said anything Gal but I'll overlook it. Why didn't you mention it to me before?""There was too much going on, I wasn't going to start bragging," she lies."Being humbled is trait a heroine needs.""We don't have time for this, Deus is coming!""Deus? What are you talking about?""I'll explain Gal," Chief Kits says.Agent Orange thought about requesting the HLV but decided not to, she was already in trouble with the Chief and didn't what her to know about her dad. It was better to let the Vice Chief make that request and she volunteer for the mission.****"This is bullshit!""It's important that our comrades are inspired to fight," Gal explains."Patriotism won't be enough.""Well brute force doesn't win all the time.""You honestly think I don't know that?!"Gal flinches.Agent Orange turns her head. "Sorry.""Your problem is that you're far too tense, you need to take a break.""I was held by an AI, that's all the break I need."No that was prison, you need R&R, come let's go shopping.""What?""Yeah just you and me, tomorrow we'll be very busy with pictures and other celebrity stuff.""I suppose," Agent Orange sighs.They make their way outside to the orange humvee Agent Orange drove in."What about your bodyguards?""What about them!"Agent Orange opens the door, Gal was about to get in but hears a familiar voice call her name."Gal, how are you doing?" Roddrick asks."Oh I'm doing good, I've become a poster girl thanks to you.""I hope you're not upset, it was merely a suggestion.""No, in fact I'm quite happy, this means further away from the front lines which will be a relief for my parents.""So um Gal, are you doing anything this evening?""No my schedule is free unless I get orders.""Would you like to go out with me?""Sigh, yes you can pick me up at 5 at the mansion.""Great I'll see you then."She enters the humvee."So where to?""Grail Mall.""Are you ok?""Yeah.""Do you not like that guy?""Yeah I like him but my dad wants me to pursue the Vice Chief.""Seriously?""Yeah, me or my siblings, I'm the best choice but he considers me a sister.""Well that's not a bad thing.""Yeah but my parents are still disappointed that I chose the military as a career. So if none of us end up with him they will blame me.""Gal you don't have put up with that shit! You're eighteen.""Yeah but still.""Gal you're all that stands between your family's freedom or enslavement. You must make them understand that!""If I became the Royal Gundam's pilot I could."Agent Orange rolls her eyes through her orange shades."I wish I was more like you, a tough as a nails woman who doesn't play by the rules.""No you don't.""Yes I do, I'm just a coward.""What are you talking about? You join the Space Force and became a mobile suit pilot and you're not even an officer. You took down four Hunter Zakus. You're an ace.""No I'm not. I lied."Agent Orange slams on the brakes. "You what!?""Yes I lied, during the Battle of Luna I hid and just made it look like I was fighting.""Spacemen Alfredo you disgust me!""I'm sorry! I just didn't expect for war to be like that, I heard the stories but to actually see it. It was just so frightening. But I swear to you right here and now that if and when the next battle comes I'll become a true ace in a day."Agent Orange sighs, "I guess I can't blame you, just don't lie again." What am I saying? I'm living a lie.****The UltimateÜberstein makes his way to the cafeteria and finds Bernkastel eating with Haro. He inhales and exhales and approaches her. "Good morning, Bernkastel.""Oh good morning.""Is everything alright?""Yeah.""Please accept this." Bernkastel's eyes widen as he presents her with a freshly picked rose."Listen Überstein, you're a good guy and all but I can't. I just can't. What we did was something that was needed but that's it." She exits the table with Haro leaving Überstein with his head down.Bernkastel boards a shuttle departing for Luna. Once it lands she makes her way to the Supreme Leader. Once she approaches the office door she inhales and exhales and knocks on the door."Who is it?""It's Ensign Wheat Sir.""You may enter.""Sir...""You're here because of Captain Vance. Rest assured I rejected her recommendation. Captain Brax was a good man, he will be missed greatly but he's not the only one I will miss. All who died severing under me will be missed and remembered greatly.""Um Sir, I'm sorry I've failed to live up to your expectations.""You're just have to try harder to live up to my expectations," he answers dryly."Yes Sir, um Sir, I um I know the truth about Marius Wing.""Is that so? Emily Ashby.""Yes Sir. Sir despite what I think, you two are relatives and...""Wheat that is territory you won't cross.""But Sir.""Enough! Don't forget your place within the hierarchy!""Yes Sir, sorry Sir.""You're dismissed.""Yes Sir." She salutes him and leaves.****A few hours later the Supreme Leader calls a meeting with his advisors. "So when can we begin preparations for the new mobile suit?""We'll begin immediately but there's a problem.""Yes?""Luna Titanium as you know it takes a long time to refine.""What are you saying? We're finally on Luna and got all the rock we'll ever need and yet we can't use it!?""No it's not that, it's just we cannot build a new mobile suit entirely of Luna Titanium in just a month a or two.""Engineering has studied several destroyed Teutonic models and has discovered that they have Luna Titanium in their vital areas," Admiral Terrence says."Sigh, if only we had access sooner like the ECF did during begins stages of WW3, no they were even experimenting before the war. So we're just use it in the vital area instead and I want the Martian material used on the first model, depending how well it works we'll use Luna/Martian Composite Armor. Get it done, this meets is adjourned."****Earth, GrailAgent Orange sat against the wall with her arms crossed, even though she was a heroine, her cold demeanor kept people away. She sees a little girl being embraced by her daddy and a single tear emerges from her eye."Ok what do you think of this outfit, will it be nice for tonight?""Yeah sure.""Come on you didn't even look, I need a honest no BS opinion.""Gal it's not up to me.""Sigh, what if I wore an orange dress?""That honestly wouldn't be a bad idea but I don't think the purple hair would match."She comes out in white. "So how do I look?""That'll do Gal, that'll do.""So tell me, what do you think of the Vice Chief?""What do you mean?""What do you mean what do you mean?! You two were together for a long time, so?""Nothing happened nor will anything happen."As they continued shopping Agent Orange finds an orange dress. "Looks nice, I bet the Vice Chief will like it as well," Gal teases."Gal shut up.""Ok, ok, just having some fun, friends do that sort of thing.""Friends? We're friends now?""Yeah, two poster girlfriends, rich feminine purple girl and tough orange blond girl."Agent Orange rolls her eyes.****"Mom dad, I'm home.""Welcome home, Gal, we heard the news, you're going to be a poster girl," her mother says happily."I'm not sure I like the thought of my daughter being used for propaganda, all the young men gawking at her!" Her dad says in disgust."Well at least she'll be further away from the lines.""Yeah that's true, I suppose it will bring more favor to the Afredo name so don't do anything stupid!""Yes dad. Dad, I'm going out on a date with Roddrick.""What?! What about the Vice Chief?!""He only sees me as a sister rather than a potential mate."He rolls his eyes, "This what you get for being in the military!""Oh come down dear, remember what you said a few weeks ago?""Yes your right, I still don't know want the Vice Chief saw in a bimbo like Bernkastel.""Oh come now, her granddad was a very well respected man and had plenty of money, he just didn't show it.""Well her granddad is rolling around in his grave for what she did! Call the girls, one of them must succeed where Gal failed in getting the Vice Chief."****The Ultimate: Bernkastel enters the briefing room while Captain Vance was talking and then she stops and glares at Bernkastel. "You're two minutes late, Wheat! This isn't the type of example the Alpha Shrikes want to set!?""Sorry Ma'am.""I think an all night patrol would suit you best so get ready."Bernkastel was stunned but salutes and leaves."Come on Captain, it was only two minutes.""Lamb, since you love her so much you go with her."Meghan had her head down and leaves as well.****Earth"I don't think your dad likes me very much.""He does, he just wants what is best for his daughters, I guarantee that if Alex wasn't in the position he's in he would be acting the same way.""So how are you liking the food?""Oh I love it.""So when do you think this war will end?""I don't know." And now there's another threat in the form of AI coming. "Starting tomorrow more military drills will in effect and Agent Orange and myself will be shipped around the Earth Republic boosting morale.""Well I'm certain you'll do a good job Gal, you're a ace pilot.""Yep," she grins. All I have to do is shoot down four enemies, but damn it that means I'll have to fight.When the meal was over they leave."So I guess I'll get you home now.""Not yet, besides i'm an adult.""But your dad!""Roddrick is just eight, I want to see your dorm, let's go back to your place and watch a movie.****"Here we are my dorm," Roddrick announces."Wow you have six rooms?""Nah, six roommates.""It's really not that different from staying at the barracks. So where's everyone?""None of have come back since we lost the Battle of Luna.""Oh well that sucks.""Hey at least it's quiet.""So you have the whole place to yourself?""Yep for now. So what do you want to watch?""To be honest I don't want to watch anything."He gazes at her perplexed. "Ok so what do you want to do?"Gal reaches into her purse and pulls out some sterilization fluid and Roddrick's eyes widen. "I'm sure you know what this is?""Gal are you serious?!""Yes, why should I wait?""Well it's precious right?""Yes of course that's why I'm giving it to you.""Well I.""Do you want to or not?""Yes I do but you're not being pressured are you?"
"Of course not, I'm certain I wanna do this.""Very I'll give you mine."They both remove their clothes and once Gal was in her bra and underwear she tells him turn around while she injects herself. A few seconds later she was ready. They begin kissing. "Ok you know what to do right?""Yes I read books.""Ok I'll start." She kisses him again and pushes him on the bed. She pulls off his briefs. "It's nice." She takes hold of his cock and begins wanking. Roddrick lets out a moan."How?""I read books too." She slowly picks up speed. She places her left hand on his balls and squeezes them gently. "This is the only thing I will do, no mouth," she thought but kisses the tip which drives Roddrick wild. She smiles and does it again and then she proceeds to kiss his balls. She proceeds to kiss the shaft and switches hands. She could feel it getting hard and veining. She slows down and then gives his cock one final kiss. "Ok I'm ready." She unclasps her white bra and then removes her white panties and stood naked and smiling at him.Roddrick stood there watching in awe as Gal approaches him slowly, her B cup breasts jiggle with each step and she slides in the bed next to him. They gaze at each other and he cups her chin. "I love you Gal." They share another kiss and then he gets on top of her. He kisses her again and then goes down and kisses her neck.He cups her right breast and kisses her left breast. She moans as he engulfs her red nipple. "Oh god your mouth feels amazing." He switches breasts."I'm going to put it in now Gal.""Do it."He adjusts himself and begins thrusting slowly. Gal moans and groans and then let's out a painful cry."Am I hurting you!""Just stop for a minute, pull out."He does and sees blood, proof that she gave him her virginity. A few minutes pass and then she tells him to put it back in. He goes slowly again, they share another kiss and they both hold hands."So this is sex, it feels good. Stupid Galen, stupid Sean, can't get real girlfriends," she thought.He slowly picks up speed."Oh god!" She moans. She puts her arms around him. "Oh, ugh, ahh, ahh!"e slows down again and her fingers gently slide down his back until they reach his ass. She licks his neck and right nipple. "Oh!" He moans and then she licks the left nipple. He resumes thrusting and he watches her breast jiggle with each thrust. He gives her left breast a squeeze, feeling her hard nipple and she wraps her legs around him."Yes! Yes! Yes!" Gal cries out in pleasure and her eyes become crossed. Roddrick slows down again. "Let me get on top.""Ok."She takes some time to clean herself while Roddrick stares at her beautiful figure. "Ok I am ready." Roddrick lays on the bed and she slowly approaches him. She gets on top and kisses him again and then his face cheeks and neck. She goes down to his chest and stomach. "I see you've begun working out.""Yes, I was tired of being skinny, the only reason I didn't get teased a lot in high school is because I was rich.""Nothing wrong with that." She wanks his cock again for a few minutes before lowering herself down on it. She begins riding him slowly and he places his hands on her asscheeks.She begins to pick up speed, causing her breasts to jiggle faster which makes Roddrick smile. He reaches for them and cups them again. He pinches the hard nipples which causes her cry out in pleasure. She goes faster and faster and she leans down and buries his face in her breasts and he starts licking, chewing and sucking on them. "Oh god don't stop!" She moans.It wasn't long before she started to get tired so Roddrick takes over doing his best to thrust upwards into her. She screams and moans. She could feel herself releasing her juices. "I had an orgasim, I just had an orgasim, my first orgasim!" She thought and collapses.Roddrick stops, "Gal, Gal are you alright?""Yes, I feel awesome. Have you cum yet?""Not yet but I'm getting close.""Ok just give me a second." Gal climbs off of him and lays there. "Go ahead and finish."He climbs back on top of her and inserts himself back inside of her and resumes thrusting. "Oh yes fuck me. Fuck me Roddrick! Fuck me Roddrick! FUCK ME RODDRICK!" He goes faster and faster and kisses her while his left hand cups her right breast. "I'm cumming again, AHHHHHH!"Roddrick thrust fast and hard and a few minutes later he feels his balls tighten, "This is it." He continues and then explodes his load into the young wet pussy of Gal the love of his life. It was an amazing feeling. The two were breathing heavily and he kisses her again and rolls off her."I love you Roddrick." They hold hands and cuddle. She looks at the time and it was nearly ten. "Let's stay like this for a while and then you can take me back home."****LunaThe Royal Gundam and Rick Dimond walked at slow pace, as soon as they approached the dark side they stop and leap into a crater. "Well it's break time," Meghan says happily."Yeah," Bernkastel says flatly."Bernkastel I'm sorry.""Meghan just drop it, you should worry about yourself.""I can't you're my friend and friends look after each other."Bernkastel sighs and eats her sandwich."Hey I have idea, how about we give each other nicknames? What do you think of Bern?"At that moment Bernkastel's mind when into overload. She thinks about Adriana."Bern? Bern?""Don't you ever call me that!" Bernkastel screams."I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"Bernkastel calms down. "It's ok, I'm sorry for yelling. Just call me Bernkastel or Wheat.""Ok.""You maybe my friend and a redhead but you're not a replacement for Adriana! She was my best friend and the only one who could call me Bern," she thought and begins weeping silently."Bernkastel?" Haro asks worriedly.Suddenly they hear explosions."It's coming from the minefield, that means they're here! Haro take cover!"Meghan takes the safety off her machine gun. "It's gonna be a long night!"The explosions grow louder and closer. "There they are!" Both women open fire at the Mobile Dolls. The Royal Gundam takes a hit and falls but gets back up. "Haro, you alright?""Yes, Bernkastel, yes Bernkastel." Bernkastel resumes firing but then pauses at the severity of the situation. There was thousands of Mobile Dolls flying pass them. One takes aim at the crater with a missile. "Out of the crater, Meghan!"The two quickly fly out and a second later the crater was widen by the missile and Mobile Dolls begin landing on the Luna surface."What can we do?" Meghan asks panically. As they watch the Mobile Dolls go by, Bernkastel pulls out her beam rifle, grips the controls and charges in. "Bernkastel don't!"The Royal Gundam shoots down five Mobile Dolls with the machine gun and then three more with the beam rifle. She knocks one down and starts stomping on until it was offline.Meghan with courage joins in and two women were screaming and cursing as they killed several Mobile Dolls. "Get some, get some, get some you fuckers!"****The Dudael Fleet was on full alert engaging the enemy. "Holly take your group to the right flank, Abigail you take the left! Moses in the middle with me, Kamala, Tsukiyomi, you and group six down to the moon!" Captain Vance barks.****"Sir, many of them are just ignoring us," the communications officer reports."Are they heading to Earth?" The Supreme Leader asks."Yes Sir and at the speed their going it will be less than three hours.""Hopefully their fleet can hold them back.""Should we open a channel?""They're on their own."****Two Mobile Dolls are destroyed by Kamala. "Ha their mechanical ass is no match for my ass!"Tsukiyomi shoots three down and throws a grenade which destroys two more. "We can do this!"The Royal Gundam slices two Mobile Dolls in half with the beam saber and then activates the beam shield to block two incoming missile shots. She activates her vulcans with takes two more down.Meghan knocks one down with the butt of her machine gun and bashes it. "There's just no end to them!""Oh there will be, there will be!" Bernkastel assures and grins evilly.****EarthAdmiral Vargas steps into the bridge. The crew could see flashing from Luna. "Everything seems to be going according the Chief of State's wishes.""Sir multiple heat sources closing in! Mobile Dolls!" A communications officer reports."What?!"The Mobile Dolls begin firing at the Celestial ships."Mobilize all mobile suits, mobile pods, fighters and bombers quickly!"Some Mobile Dolls fight while the majority fly right pass the Celestial fleet and enter Earth's atmosphere.****Grail, Earth RepublicGal and Roddrick were making out and getting in the mood again but her phone rings. "Fuck, I don't wanna answer.""You should, it could be important."She rolls her eyes, "Fine!" She exits the bed and he watches her sexy ass wiggle. She picks up the phone, sees the caller ID as Galen and she answers it. "What the fuck do you want!?"Galen: "Gal the Mobile Dolls are here, we're under attack! Where are you?"Gal: "Fuck! I'm on my way to the base.""What's wrong?" Roddrick asks worriedly."The Mobile Dolls are attacking.""Mobile Dolls? A new type of Zoya weapon?""No, I'll explain on the way, get me the command base!"****Nimrod Space Factory"Do not harm the civilians unless they attack, your orders are to destroy their military and political infrastructure," Deus instructs the Mobile Dolls.****Grail, Earth RepublicChief Kits was on her way home from a meeting with the Vice Chief Alex and the other counsel members when she was alerted to the moon. She was smiling knowing that the Zoya were softening up the new enemy like she thought but suddenly her driver slams the brakes. A Mobile Doll lands and begins roaming around. "What?!""Ma'am we should head down to the bunker," a agent suggests.She nods knowing that the other counsel members would be doing the same. The Earth Republic Palace had one installed and since it was closer she would be heading to that one rather than her private one at her estate.As her limo got close to the Earth Republic Palace a Mobile Doll flies overhead and performs a kamikaze on the Earth Republic Palace. Her eyes widen in horror, the counsel she just appointed, there's no way they could have made it to the bunker in time and it would have been her too if she gotten there earlier and the thing just got rebuilt.****As Gal and Roddrick made their way to the Grail High Command military base, they could see fire. "Gal are you sure about this?""I have to."****"It's no good Ma'am, you're Teutonic isn't ready," the mechanic says."Damn it! Is there anything else I could pilot?" Commander Barcelona asks."Just a Mobile Pod.""What?!""I'm sorry Ma'am.""Don't worry Barcelona I'll provide you with plenty of cover," Commander Balrog assures.****As soon as they reach the hanger, Gal shares another kiss with Roddrick and exits the car. "Love you!""Love you too."Gal puts on her normal suit and uses the cable to board her Templar."I'm Captain Maccabee and I'll be leading group nine, we'll be going outside the wall! Move out!"Gal gulps. "I can do this!"****Nimrod Space Factory"The Earth Republic and Zoya Remnant can slaughter as many Mobile Dolls as they want but they're only resisting the inevitable," Deus says to George Ashby."Please Emily, make it through."****EarthThe orange Teutonic fires the last rocket round which nails the target. She quickly grabs a minigun and mows down a great number of Mobile Dolls and once that runs out she bashes one with it and throws it at another.****A Mobile Doll was running by but its head is shot off. "Take that you mechanical motherfucker!" Ensign Galen screams and reloads his shotgun.Gal was hiding in a trench. "They just keep coming! Ahhhhh!" She hears a pilot on the radio."Alfredo don't lose heart! We can beat them!" Captain Maccabee says. "All troops forward!" She watches him and five others charge at the enemy only to be instantly destroyed. A Mobile Doll appears and Gal screams and shoots it down. Another appears but she knocks it down and smashes in the chest. Two more appear but she throws a grenade. Two more of her Army squad members get killed. "Chief! Chief can you hear me, this is Alfredo, my group has been overrun, we're pulling back, over."Chief Kits: "And just where you gonna pull back to?! They're literally everywhere! I've mobilized all reserves. Now be advised, you hold your ground and fight to the last person, Chief Kits out!"****LunaGroup six was being overrun, Tsukiyomi shoots down two Mobile Dolls before being shot in the cockpit. "Ahhhhhh!" Kamala was pulling back when a Mobile Dolls with a sword slices her Rick Dimond in half vertically. "My ass!"****EarthCommander Balrog in his Teutonic and Commander Barcelona in a mobile pod enter the fray with the remaining members of group nine and destroy the Mobile Dolls. The area seemed clear but then two hundred more Mobile Dolls enter from orbit."Oh fuck no!" Gal screams and takes off flying in the opposite direction."Get back here you cowardly whore!" Ensign Sean screams angrily and pursues after her. A Mobile Doll suddenly appears and blasts him away with a rocket at point blank range."Sean no!" Galen is suddenly shot in the back and goes down and is stabbed repeatedly by a Mobile Doll.****"I'm out of bullets and beam energy!" Bernkastel says as she slices a Mobile Doll with her beam shield. "We're going to have to fight our way back to The Ultimate!""Roger, let's do it!" Meghan says.****EarthThe Orange Teutonic thrust her right arm through a Mobile Doll and throws it. "Is that the best you can do, Deus?!""Help me!" Spacemen Gal screams as three Mobile Dolls fire at her."Hang on, Gal I'm coming!" The Orange Teutonic takes off and fires it's vulcans. "Got them!""Oh thank you!""Where's the rest of your group?""We got overrun, I think I'm the only one left.""We should get out of the sky.""I did it, I killed several Mobile Dolls, I'm officially an ace.""I'm not sure unmanned machines count." Another Mobile Doll appears but she shoots it down. "On second thought it really doesn't matter at this point."More Mobile Dolls appear and Agent Orange fires. Another one appears and Gal prepares to fire but realizes she out, she screams and grabs Agent Orange who quickly shoots it down. She shoves Gal off. "Bitch you tried to use me as a shield!""I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"More appear and Agent Orange blasts them all away. "Damn, I'm out of vulcan guns." Gal throw her two remaining machine gun clips. "You had those this entire time!?""I'm sorry!"Agent Orange shake her head in disgust and grabs Gal's machine gun. Eventually all ammo was spent. "All I have left is a mine. Six more were on approach. "Not good, one is a kamikaze unit.""Do something!" Gal screams."I have a plan." She fires a wire into the Templar's torso which gives off an electrical charge shutting it down. "The mechanics did a good job loading this up quick." She attaches the mine to the torso."Agent Orange what the hell?" Gal screams into the radio but it was dead. She tries starting up the controls but couldn't."I know you can't hear me Gal but there's something called survival of the fittest and unfortunately you didn't make the cut." Gal tries to activate her ejection pod but it wasn't working. "NO!" The Orange Teutonic throws the disabled Templar at the Mobile Dolls. Gal was screaming and crying while still trying to activate the ejection pod. The Orange Teutonic presses the remote detonator and the six Mobile Dolls and Templar mobile suit are gone in a fiery explosion.****The Royal Gundam and Rick Dimond make their way to The Ultimate as Captain Vance bashes a Mobile Doll with her spiked knuckle shield. "Hurry up refuel and reload!"A Crown ship explodes. "Shit!" Meghan exclaims."All remaining Alpha Shrikes rally to The Ultimate and defend it!"Abigail shoots several Mobile Dolls and impales one with her javelin. Holly uses her retractable claws and Moses slices many in half with his labrys.After reloading, the Royal Gundam steps on the catapult. "Ensign Bernkastel Wheat, Royal Gundam launching!"Meghan's Rick Dimond steps on the catapult. "Yee ha!"The Royal Gundam fires a bazooka round and starts using her machine gun.Meghan pulls out both of her anti ship rifles and takes down two Mobile Dolls simultaneously. "I hate wasting on non capital ships but fuck it!""I don't care how many there are, the Zoya Remnant will not fall to an AI!" Supreme Leader Dudael declares which gives his troops a boost of morale.The Royal Gundam fires another bazooka round and then bashes another Mobile Doll with the bazooka. She lets out a battle cry and Royal's white monoeye glows. She kicks a Mobile Doll's head clean off. She mows down several more with her machine gun and vulcans and charges straight through. Several surround her and fire but she uses her boosters to ram into one. She uses all the bazooka rounds and then throws it at a Mobile Doll and pulls out her heat hammer.For a moment the other Shrikes stare in awe as the Royal Gundam destroys wave after wave of Mobile Dolls and then they watch as she flies further and further away from the Dudael Fleet to fight the thousands of Mobile Dolls still coming. "What the hell are you doing, Wheat?! Get back here!" Captain Vance radios but there was no response.****EarthThe Orange Teutonic hits two Mobile Dolls with a shovel but suddenly its left leg was blown off. She looks up to see the Mobile Doll closing in on her but suddenly two missiles bring it down. She looks and sees a fighter but it wasn't just any fighter it was the Pterosaur Interceptor and she knew only one person who was flying it. She turns and sees a injured Mobile Doll crawling towards her and leaps at it. She grabs its machine gun and aims it at the Pterosaur Interceptor. "There's no way out of this, I am going to die, we can't win so at least I'll take one person from the kill list with me."Suddenly the shockwave of a MOAB knocks her unconscious. More missiles and bombs hit the area but it only slows down the Mobile Dolls and they continue their relentless assault.When the sun rises the Mobile Dolls leave Earth and Luna."This is Deus to the Earth Republic and Zoya Remnant, this isn't a retreat, I simply recalled the Mobile Dolls. That was your punishment, I strongly urge you all to surrender and adapt to your new bodies however, if you wish to continue resisting then I will allow you to vainly gather what force you have left and meet me at my space factory to see who is stronger, I await your reply."To be continued...
