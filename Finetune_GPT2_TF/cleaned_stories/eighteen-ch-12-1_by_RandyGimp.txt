I tell him that one of the girls he was ogling after practice the other day hasn't been asked by anyone."Yeah? Which one?" he asks jokingly.I glare at him, "It's not my girlfriend, spazoid; it's Jesse."He laughs and says, "Cool...she's the prettier one anyway."I glare at him again. He slaps me on the back and, with a grin, tells me he's just messing with me and that I need to lighten up. I let him know that Jesse is reluctant to go, but with some prodding, she agreed. I also tell him that he needs to tread lightly and be a perfect gentleman, or I won't introduce him. He promises he will, so after practice, I introduce him to Jesse.I want to build him up a little and break the ice, so I say, "Jesse, this is Mark. He's one of the hardest workers on our team and has helped me a lot with my technique."Mark looks at Jesse and says nervously, "Hey, Jesse. It's nice to meet you."Jesse blushes and timidly replies, "Nice to meet you too, Mark."Mark asks Jesse if she wants to get some pizza; she looks hesitant but accepts his invitation, and they leave together. Christina and Nicole give me worried looks, but I explain that he promised to be a gentleman, so things should be okay."My parents will be home any minute," Christina says suddenly. "I have to get home.""I'll go with you," Nicole tells Christina, and they leave while I go to work.Wednesday, January 20thI see the girls sitting at the lunch table, deep in conversation, and I wonder how Jesse did with Mark yesterday. He didn't say anything to me about her at practice, so I hope everything's okay. Despite my curiosity, I don't want to listen to their girl talk again, so I make up an excuse to leave after dropping by to say hi. When Jesse sees me in class later, she sits next to me with a stern look on her face."So, I start hanging out, and all of a sudden, you're a ghost?""It's not like that," I reply."Tell me then, how is it? Don't help me feel paranoid here," she says, almost in tears."I just figured you needed some bonding time with Christina and Nicole without a guy around, and...," I pause, "I get really embarrassed with all the teasing."Her face relaxes a little when she says, "If it were any other guy, I'd appreciate that, but not with you. You're my Superman, and I want you around."Superman? "I like being around you too," I say more seriously, "but I don't want to get in the way. The three of you have a lot of years to catch up on. I can tell that you guys are on the verge of becoming good friends, and I know what that'll mean to you. So I don't want to get in the way of that happening."Jesse relaxes. "Look, I'll make you a deal," she says. "If you don't avoid me--""I'm not avoiding you--""Shhh!" Jesse shoves her finger against my lips. "Let me finish. When you're around, I'll try to stop teasing you. But, you HAVE to lay off the cutesy name-calling thing, AND you HAVE to stop calling me Jennifer."I wait a few seconds to make sure Jesse has finished. "I can lay off using cutesy names, no problem, but you'll have to speak to Christina about that too. As far as calling you Jennifer...I can't promise I won't use your real name. I love the sound of it, and whether you think so or not, it does fit you."Jesse's in a better mood now and jokingly punches me in the shoulder as she says, "Okay, we'll make some concessions here. I'll try to not throw up when the two of you are being sappy, and you try to not call me Jennifer."Jesse's a whole different person from when I first met her, she seems happier and more confident, and I'm glad she's become a good friend. There's a warmth to her smile, but occasionally there's a fire in her eyes that burns hot. When she gets that look, it's as if she's looking through me, and her glare makes me shiver."How'd your date go with Mark?" I ask."Date?""Okay...did you enjoy being with Mark when you guys went to get some pizza?""It was fine," she says in a low and even tone.Just fine? That worries me a little, but I figure she'll share as much as she feels comfortable with, so I drop it.After school, I meet Christina at our usual place. She's standing there, tapping her foot as I walk up. I give her a hug and ask if everything's okay."Fine," she exclaims. "Took you long enough to get here."I'm set back because she's usually pretty easygoing. "I put my books away and ran into Jim, who reminded me, again, that I need to get my tux."She takes a deep breath and lets it out with a sigh as I put my arms around her and pull her in close. She lays her head on my shoulder and tells me she's sorry."How's it going with Jesse?" I ask worriedly. "Did you have a chance to talk with your parents?""It's terrific," she says. "She's awesome. I don't know why we didn't become friends years ago. While Jesse was out with Mark, I filled my parents in on what was going on. They wondered whose stuff was in one of the guest rooms. So it was the perfect time to explain what happened and ask if we could help her."Christina tells me that her parents sat down with Jesse when she got home, got to know her, and evaluated how they could help. The conversation lasted a couple of hours. They agreed she could stay with them until the end of the school year, but she must follow their rules. Christina's dad said he'll get one of his work trucks, and they'll go over to her friend's house and get her stuff."I think they're going to move her things this afternoon," Christina says. "My mom is actually pretty excited and asked Jesse if she'd like to go shopping for some new clothes."Christina's face brightens as she gives me the news, and I'm happy her parents are going to help."Oh. Before I forget," Christina adds, "you need to be at my house tomorrow night after work.""I do? I don't get off until eight-thirty. Won't that be kind of late?""No, it'll be fine. Just come straight from work."If I don't get going, I will be late for practice, so I give Christina another hug and kiss and tell her I'll see her tomorrow.Thursday, January 21stI pull up to the Taylor's after work, dead tired. It's been a hectic week, and I'd rather be crawling in bed, but Christina said I need to be here, so I'm complying. I lumber to the door and ring the bell. Mr. Taylor answers, invites me in, and I follow him to the kitchen without any conversation.Christina, Nicole, and Jesse are there, and Mrs. Taylor is lighting candles on a cake."Whose birthday is it?" I ask."Jesse's," Christina answers.Jesse turns around and looks at me, red-faced. You can tell she's embarrassed about the whole ordeal."Uhm...Jesse's birthday was last month," I say."Yeah, well...we're celebrating it tonight because she didn't have a chance to celebrate it then," Christina answers."You should have told me! I would have gotten her something," I whisper in Christina's ear.We start singing, and Jesse gets even more embarrassed. She isn't used to having this kind of attention paid to her. When we finish, everyone, and I do mean everyone, looks over at me."What?" I ask.Christina chuckles and asks, "Did you do that on purpose?""Do what?"The whole group gets sheepish looks on their faces."Sing like that.""Sing like what?""Your voice was flat and sounded like a cat being stepped on."It's my turn to be embarrassed. I know I'm not a singer, but I didn't realize how bad I sounded. So I apologize, have a slice of cake and some ice cream, and then excuse myself because it's getting late."Do you have to go so soon?" Christina asks.I give Jesse a hug, wish her a happy birthday, and then look at Mr. Taylor and ask, "Would you mind if I borrow your daughter for a moment?"He says, "Go right ahead. Maybe you can put her in a better mood."I face her and playfully pick her up, throwing her over my shoulder like a sack of potatoes. Unfortunately, her butt sticks straight in the air, which doesn't bode well since she's wearing a skirt. I walk to the front door while she pounds on my back with her fists in protest."Daddy! Are you going to let him do this to me?" Christina yells out."You'll be fine, pumpkin."We round the corner to the living room, and I give her butt a slap to which she objects even more."Hey, it's not my birthday; I'm not the one that's supposed to get spanked!"We get to the door, and I set her on her feet. Her face is red, and she starts hitting my chest with her hands. I pull her close, and we kiss hard. At first, she isn't into it but then relaxes, opens her mouth, and lets her tongue play with mine. I drop my hands to her ass and put them under her skirt to caress her cheeks.Christina quickly pulls away. "Careful, buddy," she warns.I give her a questioning look."Be careful where you put your hands; you may find something you don't want to."I have sisters and a mom and get the hint, so I put my hands back on her waist, push her against the wall and kiss her deeply."I've really missed having alone time with you," I say."Me too," she answers. "But, we picked a good week to be too busy to be with each other."I kiss her again and tell her I'll see her later."Not so fast," she demands. "When are we going to go out again? We should have at least one date a week, and you haven't taken me out in a while.""I'm sorry," I say. "This week's been crazy. I'm off tomorrow night at eight-thirty again, and Saturday, I'm off at four-thirty. But, I don't have to work on Sunday if that's any consolation.""How about we go out tomorrow night?" Christina asks. "We can get some pizza or just hang out or something.""That sounds great. I'll pick you up around nine-thirty?""I have a better idea. How 'bout I come and watch you practice tomorrow afternoon, take you to work, and then pick you up when you're finished. We can get something to eat straight from there.""I won't be able to shower and change.""I don't care. I want to spend as much time with you as I can.""It's a date then."Her mom comes around the corner and clears her throat, so I let go of Christina, kiss her on her forehead, and walk out the door.Friday, January 22ndI don't see when Christina arrives at my practice because I'm doing laps, but at the end of a set, Mark splashes water on me, so I look at him, and he points to the bleachers. My goggles are fogged, so I pulled them off to see Jesse and Christina sitting there. Jesse came too? I lean on the lane divider and ask Mark if he's taking Jesse to the dance. He tells me he is and that they've already been on a second date. I'm happy that he and Jesse are getting along so well.After practice, Mark and I make our way to the bleachers. Jesse and Mark's greeting is casual, while Christina, on the other hand, jumps on me, wraps her arms and legs around me, and plants her lips on mine with a friendly greeting. I hold her tight and reciprocate with a long deep kiss. Then, Jesse and Mark go off to where I don't know, while Christina takes me to work.***************My shift ends, and I promptly leave so I can meet Christina in the parking lot. I get in my car on the passenger side, and she drives to the pizza parlor, where we sit and eat while catching up. We have a lot to discuss because we haven't spent much time together this week. Christina's eyes sparkle as I look at her."What are you doing after work tomorrow?" she asks."Cleaning the apartment. I haven't had much time for that this week.""Can we go shopping?""Shopping? Me? I'm not really much of a shopper...Why take me?""You need to get your tux and some clothes.""My tux! I completely forgot. Yeah...do you mind going with me to get it?""I think I just suggested that, and I think it's the only way it's going to happen. You know the dance is in four weeks, right?""Four weeks? I've got plenty of time then.""Not if you want to be able to choose a tux instead of having to wear what's left over.""Okay, after work, I'm all yours. You have me for as long as you want.""Good answer!" she says, grinning.I take Christina home and walk her to the door. We're making out when someone taps me on the shoulder. I freeze and turn around. It's Jesse, and she's standing next to us, stoically, with her arms folded. Whew! I'm glad it's not her dad!"Do you guys know how to do anything else besides make out?""Uh, yeah. We could give you lessons if you want," I say as I move my hands down to Christina's hips and pull her into me.Jesse jokingly gets a look of horror on her face and says, "Ew, yuck. No! I don't want to see that!""Really? You didn't seem to mind me seeing your tits in the library when we first met.""Hey, that wasn't my idea, and besides, I'm not like that anymore," she says, defending herself. Then, she playfully sticks her tongue out at me and pushes her way around us to go into the house. I give Christina another kiss and tell her goodnight.Saturday, January 23rdI get home from work, and I'm dog-tired. Nobody should have to work on the weekends! I walk in the door, and Christina is sitting on the couch reading a book. When she sees me, she gets up and gives me the friendly greeting she knows I love. There's an intensity in her kiss that I haven't felt in a while. My dad walks into the room and clears his throat, so we break apart."Hey, Dad.""Kissing the maid?" he asks."Huh?" I ask while looking at Christina.She smiles and waves her hand around the apartment like a game show host. It's nice and clean."She showed up a couple hours ago and insisted on cleaning the place up. I told her it's your job, but she's persistent."I look at Christina in wonderment."I did your laundry, and I cleaned your room too...slob," she teases."Your dad's going to kill me if he finds out.""Then don't tell him," she laughs.I shower and dress so we can go shopping. Dad says he'll be gone until tomorrow night and reminds us to stay out of trouble.We walk out the door, and Christina gives me directions to the tuxedo place. I've never seen or been in a store like it before; it's nothing like what I expected. They not only rent tuxes but also sell suits and other really nice men's wear.The salesperson brings out different styles for Christina to see, and she's more than happy to have me just stand there and be a model while they take care of the details. When everything is said and done, I like the way I look. We make the needed arrangements to get the tux the day before the dance, and we leave."Now what, my queen?""Let's go to the mall.""The mall?"It's hot for the middle of January, almost ninety degrees outside. The East Coast is freezing their asses off while we're walking around in shorts and sandals. It doesn't seem quite fair, well, to them, at least. When the Santa Ana's blow, it feels like summer during wintertime.While wandering around, we run into Nicole near the entrance to one of the large department stores, sitting on the edge of a fountain. This smells like a setup. What do they have in mind? The girls greet one another nonchalantly, and we walk into the store. We make our way to the men's section, where they start pulling clothes off the rack and holding them up to me."What am I, some sort of doll for you guys to dress up?" I ask. "Why do both of you need to take me clothes shopping?""Because we're tired of seeing you in the same thing every day," Christina responds."Okay, but why does it take two of you?""Nicole wanted to come along, so I said okay.""Because I have to look at you too," Nicole teases.Resigned to the situation, I grit my teeth and let the girls do what they like to do.They have a bundle of clothes they want me to try on, so I go into a dressing room with my arms loaded down. I strip down to put on some shorts and a shirt when Nicole pulls the curtain open."We found this for you to...to try on too. Uh...Christina, will you come here, please?""What is it?" she asks as she walks up and looks at me. "Well, what do we have here?"They walk in and let the curtain fall behind them. I'm standing in front of them, buck naked. Nicole walks up to me, drops to her knees, and takes hold of my cock. She pumps it a few times and then licks my shaft from balls to tip."Uhm...girls...we're in a changing room, in the department store?"Nicole looks up at me with pleading eyes and says, "I know where we are. Now, shhh, or someone will hear us!"Nicole sucks my cock into her mouth, teasing my slit with her tongue. Christina kneels down and unties the strap that's holding Nicole's halter top up. Then, she cups Nicole's tits and pulls on her nipples while kissing her neck. Nicole's eyes are locked on mine as she bobs her head on my shaft.Christina moves to the side of Nicole and licks my balls before sucking a testicle in her mouth. Wrapping her lips around my scrotum, Christina sucks, pulling it tight in her mouth. Having Nicole work on my cock while Christina sucks my balls is an incredible feeling. I haven't had this kind of attention for a while and fight the urge to come.Nicole releases my cock with a pop and stands up. After unbuttoning her shorts, she lets them fall to the ground. Still on her knees, Christina turns to face Nicole and lowers Nicole's panties to the floor. Christina tongues Nicole's clit while holding Nicole's ass in her hands. My cock is so hard; it's sticking straight up, almost touching my stomach."Nicole, lean over and put your hands against the wall," Christina whispers.Nicole obeys and sticks her ass out, pushing her pussy through her thighs. I step behind her, drop to my knees, and slide my tongue into her wet cunt. Tasting Nicole brings back carnal memories of our day together at Christina's house. Nicole moans, and Christina grabs her head and pulls her in for a kiss. The changing room echoes with the sounds of slurping and spit swapping. I can't reach Nicole's clit with my mouth, so I rub it with my finger while licking her. Her hips rock and my tongue slides out of her pussy and ends up on her asshole. Nicole moans again, so I spread her cheeks and push my tongue into her rosebud, poking it in and out. Nicole pushes her ass against my face, forcing my tongue into her further.I stand to a crouch, align my cock with Nicole's entrance, and slide into her. She pushes against me again, just as I thrust into her. Then, grabbing her hips, I pull her against me hard, and her head flies back as we get a rhythm going. While I'm fucking Nicole, Christina is sucking on her nipples."I'm going to come, Nicole.""Come inside me!"I'm not one to argue. My cum shoots up my rod and into her velvety warm tunnel as my balls pulse. Somehow, the walls of her pussy squeeze my cock as I'm coming, and it feels incredible. I bury myself into her as far as I can and empty my load. She grunts, and her head drops to find Christina's lips, and they kiss again. I'm still hard and don't want to pull out, so I slowly piston my cock inside Nicole. I'm coated in white cream as our fluids mix and drip out of her. Wrapping my hand under her, I play with her clit while continuing to fuck her from behind.Christina kneels at my side and pushes me away from Nicole to access her freshly fucked pussy. Her tongue goes wild as she sucks our cum from Nicole's cunt. Her mouth clamps over Nicole's pussy as she pulls on her labia with her lips. My cock is over Christina's shoulder as I watch, and some cum drips from my cock, hitting Christina's neck. Christina turns around, takes my cock into her mouth, and bathes it with her tongue and lips. Nicole turns around and gets on her knees to join Christina, and they lick every bit of cum from my shaft. Christina stands up, and we kiss, our tongues swirling around in each other's mouths. The taste of Nicole and my cum in her mouth drives me crazy. My cock is still hard, so I unbutton Christina's shorts and pull the zipper down, but she slaps my hand away."It's too soon," she warns."I don't care," I say. "I want you!""You'll have to wait."Nicole stands up, and Christina goes back to bathing my cock. Taking Nicole in my arms, I kiss her deeply. My hand grabs her tit, and I massage it, pinching her nipple between my fingers. I break the kiss and suck her nipple into my mouth, teasing it with my tongue.Christina pumps my cock while sucking on it frantically while massaging my balls, and I feel them tightening again."I'm going to come, Christina."She moans on my cock, which sends me over the edge, and I spray the inside of her mouth with my hot cum. White cream seeps from the corners of her lips as I fill her up. After licking every last drop of cum from my dick, Christina gets up and kneels behind Nicole, and pushes her into her former position against the wall. Christina puts two fingers in Nicole's pussy and pumps them in and out while her thumb presses against her clit. Using her shoulders to rest her body against the wall, Nicole reaches back and pulls her ass cheeks apart. Christina gets the hint and tongues Nicole's rosebud, pressing into her as far as she can go.Nicole's moaning gets louder, so I sit on the bench between Nicole and the wall. She lowers her head, and we kiss, hard, as Christina works on her. Nicole sucks my tongue into her mouth as she's moaning, and then her body stiffens and quivers before her legs give out. I'm glad I'm holding onto her, or else she'd be on the floor.Nicole is in my arms, trying to catch her breath when Christina kneels over her and kisses her. Christina then stands up and gives me a passionate kiss too. It's all I can do to keep myself under control around these two. They are insatiable. Christina finally pulls away and straightens her clothes before helping Nicole get dressed. They look in the mirror, fix their hair, and then walk out of the stall as if nothing happened.Christina says, "Think you can try that stuff on now?"I grin and try everything on, keeping what they like. We're walking to the register when Christina stops and pulls a pair of board shorts off the rack. She holds them up to me to see how they look."What do I need those for?" I ask."Get the green ones," Nicole says.Christina holds the green pair in front of me and looks me up and down, saying, "We're going to the beach tomorrow.""We are?""Yep, Nicole's driving."They add the green shorts to everything else and take it all to the register. Christina breaks out a credit card and gives it to the lady."My treat.""You guys can take me shopping anytime you want," I say with a huge smile.We leave the store and grab something to eat at the food court before Nicole parts ways with us.Christina and I go back to my apartment, and nobody's home, so we put the new clothes in the hamper, and then I push her onto my bed and lie on top of her. I look into her deep blue eyes and kiss her nose. She wraps her arms around my neck and her legs around my waist as we kiss again.She feels me stiffening and says, "I want you so bad right now.""You have me.""No! I WANT you, but we need to wait another day. Ugh," she says with a deep sigh."We don't have to wait. I don't care. I want to fuck you right now!""Eww! Too messy. We can wait."I try to roll off of her, but her legs hold me firm. I look at her again, and she has a soft smile, and her eyes glisten as her lips pucker a little. She seems so bussable, and I can't help myself, so I dive into her and lose myself in her love. I don't know how long we lie there kissing, but I'm fully hard and pressing into Christina's rocking mound when she moans and my shorts get wet. We stop. Panting heavily, I look at her beautiful face."How does it feel, knowing you can get me off just by kissing me?" I ask."Join the club," she replies with a big smile.She lets go of me, so I roll off to her side, and we lie there touching and caressing each other with our fingertips as we gaze into each other's eyes."It's late; I should probably go home," she says."What if I don't want you to go? Stay here with me.""Tempting. You don't know how tempting, but not tonight."I huff and get up, taking her by her hands and pulling her into my arms.She reaches up and kisses me on the nose, "C'mon, let's go before we get into trouble."After changing my shorts, I take her home and walk her to her door. When the door shuts, loneliness floods over me. It's as if there's a barrier to a void that I can't cross, and she's gone.We've only known each other for just under two months and have done so much with each other. We've gotten to know each other so well, and she's become an integral part of me. When she isn't with me, there's a deep emptiness in my soul that feels like the vacuum of space, and the more time I spend with her, the more difficult it is to be apart.Sunday, January 24thI dream of Christina sleeping with me. Having her next to me with her boobs pushing against my chest and her nose snuggled into my neck. I love holding her like this when we sleep. She drops her hand down and fondles my cock, making me hard. Leaning over, she engulfs my hard shaft into her warm, wet mouth. There is a delightful pressure being hard. Her lips touch mine as she kisses me...but wait...she's giving me a blowjob...another kiss...what? I slowly come out of the fog of sleep to see Christina leaning over me. She's smiling, and her eyes are aglow. I still feel a mouth and tongue in my groin, so I look down, and Nicole's there."See, I told you that'd wake him up," Christina says to Nicole. "C'mon sleepy head, get up. We're going to the beach, remember?""What? Wait! How?" I mutter, trying to figure out what's going on. Then, as the fuzz clears, I remember it's Sunday, and they said we're going to the beach...the beach. I sit up as Nicole releases me from her mouth, and I swing my legs to the floor, wiping the sand from my eyes. I focus on the blur to find Christina and Nicole standing there in t-shirts and shorts. It suddenly hits me that Christina is in my apartment, and I know I locked the door last night."C'mon, get up!" Christina says. "Get your suit on so we can go.""Wait. How'd you get in here?" I ask."Your key, remember? You told me to make a copy of it so I could come here and study while I waited for you to come home from practice.""Oh...yeah. I forgot."I stand up and reach for my new swim trunks when Nicole says, "He should probably shower first. He's a little musty downstairs."Christina and Nicole pull me up and lead me to the bathroom. The quick shower helps me wake up, so I get out, dry off, and get in the swimsuit Christina bought for me. I open the closet to look for a beach towel when they pull me by the arms and tell me they already have everything we need. So, I slip on my thongs, grab my wallet and keys, and follow them out the door. They ask me to drive so I won't have to sit in the back, and Christina can sit next to me.We get to the car, and Jesse's in the back seat. "Took you guys long enough!""We had to wake him up, and he needed a shower," Nicole replies.Nicole and Jesse are in the back giggling and whispering almost all the way to the beach while Christina sits next to me, rubbing her hand up and down my leg. I look at her, and she smiles, knowing the effect she's having on me.When we get there, we find a somewhat secluded area on the sand. There are more people here than I thought there'd be in January, but it's been hot in the Valley, and people need relief.Usually, when I go to the beach, I just bring a towel, sunscreen, and a smile but not these ladies. They've brought an umbrella, beach chairs, and towels along with all the essentials of a successful day. They even packed lunch and a cooler full of sodas and water. It seems they have everything but the kitchen sink.They peel their shirts and shorts from their bodies, exposing their bikinis, and I try not to have lewd thoughts about them. How'd I get so lucky to be at the beach with these hot babes?Nicole's suit I've seen before, but her bottoms seem skimpier than I remember. The little triangle barely covers her camel toe, and the thin string up her ass completes the view.I've never seen Christina in a bikini before, and man is she sexy. She too has three small triangles, but her suit is white and, in my imagination, see-through. I'd love to see that suit wet! The sight of her makes me hunger for...no...crave her.I look over at Jesse, and she's smokin' hot. She has more material and fills it out spectacularly, looking like a goddess to be worshipped. Her breasts push her top out, and her nipples make large imprints that tempt me to suck on them. I shake my head and remember she's not my girlfriend, and I shouldn't have these types of thoughts about her. She isn't wearing a thong, but her bottoms are a thin piece of material that's tied at her hips. The fabric begins a few inches below her belly button, travels under her pussy, and back up her ass. She turns around to wipe sand from her butt cheeks, showing me a perfect "V" of material that clings in her crack.My bulge pushes hard against my shorts as I ogle these sex idols. It's a good thing I'm their friend because otherwise, they'd probably have me arrested for leering at them.Christina puts sunscreen on me and then asks Nicole if she wants some too. She does and turns over on her stomach. Christina kneels over her and undoes Nicole's top to massage Nicole's back with lotion. Christina's hands linger on the sides of Nicole's boobs, so she leans up on her elbows to give Christina better access. Christina cups Nicole's tits and pinches her nipples while leaning down on her and nibbling her earlobe. Nicole moans and raises her ass in the air, pushing against Christina.Christina turns around and focuses on Nicole's lower half, untying Nicole's bottoms on the sides and pushing what material there is between her legs. Nicole spreads her legs out, and Christina squirts some lotion on her cheeks and down her crack. Nicole squeals at the cold and shakes her ass. Christina rubs the cream into Nicole's skin, running her fingers down her crack before cupping her pussy. Christina then applies sunscreen to Nicole's legs and tells her to turn over.Jesse's wide-eyed as she looks on attentively; apparently, this is the first time she's seen these two together like this.Christina scoots up and kneels over Nicole's waist, and leans down, kissing her. She squeezes lotion on each of Nicole's tits and then massages it in, paying particular attention to her nipples. Christina finishes applying sunscreen to the rest of Nicole's body and then asks her to return the favor.Christina lies face down on her towel while Nicole puts her suit back on and kneels over Christina. When Nicole gets to her ass, Christina spreads her legs and pushes her cheeks into the air. Nicole slides her fingers between Christina's folds, which elicits a long moan and some hip rocking. Nicole finishes her back and tells Christina to turn over. She removes Christina's top and massages her torso with the cream, but before getting anything on her tits, she leans down and sucks a nipple into her mouth, flicking it with her tongue. Then, she spreads sunscreen over Christina's breasts while pinching and pulling on her nipples.By this time, Jesse's mouth has dropped open, and she looks stunned by the show.Nicole finishes by leaning over and kissing Christina deeply before sitting up and looking over at Jesse."How about you? Would you like some too?" Nicole asks.Jesse comes out of her trance, and her voice cracks when she answers, "Uh...well...uhm...okay."Nicole moves over to Jesse while she turns over onto her stomach. She sits on her ass and unties her top before she spreads sunscreen on her back. She works the cream into Jesse's shoulder muscles and runs her hands up and down the sides of Jesse's torso before turning around to squeeze some on Jesse's cheeks."How do you want your butt done?" Nicole asks. "Want me to undo your bottoms, so I don't get any on your suit?"Uhm...yeah, I guess."Nicole unties the sides of Jesse's bottoms and sets the material between her legs to make it easier to work on her cheeks. She squirts a little in her crack and creeps her fingers slowly downward, waiting to see how Jesse responds. Jesse lifts her hips, and that's all the invitation Nicole needs to continue down...all the way down.Nicole turns her head towards us and mouths the words, "Very wet."Jesse moans loudly as she raises her hips further and spreads her legs wider. Nicole keeps constant attention on Jesse's sex until she groans out a very loud moan and her legs tremble. Finally, Nicole turns back around and slides down to Jesse's feet while telling her to turn over. She rolls over and covers herself with her hands as her top falls off."Don't be shy," Nicole says. "Tom's already seen you, and Christina and I have our own."Jesse looks over at us and lets her hands fall to her side. Nicole takes her finger, slides it under the triangle hiding Jesse's bush, and works her finger around Jesse's clit until she rocks her hips. Next, Nicole pulls the front of her bottoms down and slides in between her legs, causing them to spread further.Nicole sucks on Jesse's swelling labia, which causes Jesse to gasp while she puts her hand on the back of Nicole's head, grabbing her hair. Nicole works two fingers into her and presses up into Jesse's g-spot while she licks and sucks on her clit. Jesse is rocking her hips now and almost screaming. Her breaths get shallow, and she arches her back before relaxing with a deep sigh. Nicole gets up and spreads sunscreen on Jesse's torso and works it in, making sure to give ample attention to her boobs. Nicole pulls on Jesse's nipples and pinches them between her slippery fingers. Jesse moans some more, so Nicole leans down and gives her a light kiss on the lips."There, all done," Nicole says."In more ways than one," Jesse pants. "That was amazing, I've never had anyone go down on me before, and I never dreamed that a woman would do that to me.""Never? Well, it's new for Christina and me too, and if she ever lets Tom do that for you," she continues, "you're in for a real treat."I'm rock hard after watching that, and my cock strains severely against my shorts. Christina leans over, takes my bulge in her hands, and rubs it up and down. She goes to lower my shorts, but I stop her and nod towards Jesse."Jesse?" Christina asks. "Tom's in a little pain here. Would you mind if I relieve it in front of you?"Her eyes widen again as she says, "Uh, no. I guess not. Especially with what's already happened."Christina removes my trunks, and I'm completely naked on the beach with my boner sticking straight up. She takes me in her mouth and gives me one hell of a blowjob in front of her friends. When she achieves her goal, she leans over to Nicole and shares my spent cum with her. I soften a little but know I'm going to get hard again watching Christina and Nicole, so I tell the girls I'm going for a swim, and Nicole dares me to skinny dip."Are you kidding? Walk around naked on a public beach?""Go on, just do it," Christina urges."Oh, come on," Nicole says. "There's hardly anyone here. I triple dog dare you.""You dare me? What if the patrol comes by and arrests me for indecent exposure?""We'll talk them out of it," Christina says.It's futile to argue with them, so I shrug, stand up, and walk to the water, looking around to see if anyone notices me. There really aren't that many people here, and those I can see are in their own worlds, so I don't worry about it and jump in the water.It's so cold, my penis retracts into my body like a scared turtle, and my balls pull up, searching for some warmth. I finally get used to the cold and enjoy the warm sun beat down while playing in the refreshing salt water. When I've had enough, I walk back towards the girls, again looking around to see if anyone notices me. As I top the rise, I see three guys talking with the girls. Quietly walking up behind them, I put my finger over my lips so the girls won't give me away.I lower my voice and say, "Can I help you, gentlemen?"Startled, they turn around and look up at me."No, we're just talking with these girls," one of them says."These aren't girls," I say. "They're ladies."I push through them and drop to my knees on my towel. Then, spinning around, I land on my butt and lie down. Their mouths drop open when they notice I'm naked.Christina leans over to kiss me as she grabs my cock and massages it, bringing it back out in the open. Nicole's on the other side of me, and she also leans over, and we share a three-way kiss as she grabs on to me too. With the two of them kissing and fondling me, the turtle comes out of its shell proudly. We stop what we're doing, and I look up at the three guys whose chins have dropped further than before. They look like their heads are going to explode."You still here?" I ask."Uh...," one of them says.Jesse gets their attention by waving at them and saying, "Buh-bye now, it's been fun talking with you."They stumble away, looking over their shoulders several times, and when they get out of earshot, we chuckle."You guys are bad...bad to the bone!" Jesse says."I tried to warn you about these two," I laugh.I put my shorts back on, and we enjoy ourselves, eating and laughing. It's the best time I've ever had at the beach. Unfortunately, we're interrupted when the beach patrol walks up to us and gives us nasty glares."We've had some complaints about your behavior on the beach," one of them says. "This is a public beach, and there's no nudity allowed."Nicole stands up, sashays over to the officers, puts her hand on one of their shoulders, and leans in close as she asks in a sultry voice, "Is the complaint by three short dudes who looked rather...frustrated?"He looks at her, "As a matter of fact, yes.""Yeah...they're just upset because we wouldn't give them our phone numbers. Do you see us flashing our privates around?""No, but just in case, keep it clean," he says."Yes, Officer," we all say at once as they walk away, shaking their heads.The sun gets low in the sky, and the air cools quite a bit, so we pack up and go back to the car.When we get back to my place, Christina and I get out. She asks Nicole to drop her stuff off at her house because she's staying with me for a little while, so Nicole and Jesse take off while Christina and I walk up the stairs.We go inside and strip down, throwing our suits in the hamper before taking a shower to get the sand and sunscreen off us. Once we're nice and clean, we go back to my room and lie down.Taking Christina in my arms, we fall together on the bed laughing as I tickle her. Then rolling on my back, I pull her on top of me, and we lie there, staring into each other. My mind gets quiet as everything around us dissolves; all I hear is her breathing, all I see is her beauty, and all I feel is her body resting on me. It's the two of us, alone in the universe, sharing our souls in silence.Spreading my legs, I wrap them around my sweetheart and lock her against me. Her beauty transcends our mortal existence, and I can't resist her. Her lips beckon to me as I trace them with my index finger. She smiles softly as I sink my fingers into her wet mane and pull her into me. We kiss. It's not a sensual or sexual kiss, but it merges my soul with hers, and we become one. I've been utterly flaccid until now, but as we kiss, I become engorged and feel how moist she is, as her hips rock, brushing her clit against me. As I get hard, I drop my legs to the side, and she lifts her hips searching for my cock, and presses into me. Our hips move in a cadence that brings us apart and back into each other perfectly, slow and methodically. I pull my lips from hers and use my fingers to caress her beautiful features and feel absolute peace."I love you so much!" I whisper."I love you too."She sits up and picks up her pace, and I let her go awhile before I roll us over, putting her on the bottom. I have my weight on my elbows as I look at her."I've missed this so much!" I say with a deep yearning in my voice."Me too."I feel her urgency and plunge into her. She grunts as she meets my thrusts and pushes against me. I stop and then press deep inside her before slowly pulling myself almost all the way out and then drive back into her. Her eyebrows furrow as she moans, and I repeat this until the pace is furious. I slow my breathing as I plunge into her and her body tenses."Ready?" I pant."Re...ad...y...," she groans.I push deep and do mini-thrusts as my silk surges into her. She yells, groans, and moans, all at the same time. I pull back, almost out of her again, and then push in slowly--our warm fluids mixing as I continue sliding in and out. Driving in deep one last time, I hold myself there until her breathing becomes steady, and she relaxes. Her face is peaceful, and her warm smile returns. Her eyes twinkle and glisten as I look into them. We kiss again, deeply, as we lie there motionless, feeling our hearts beat rapidly and our beads of sweat mingle. I soften and slip out of her as we turn on our sides, holding each other tight. I eventually roll on my back, and she puts her leg over me, resting her head on my chest.We lie there, peaceful and quiet. It's moments like this that I never want to end. Never ever. I look at the clock, and it's seven. I sigh deeply as I tell her the time. We get up, reluctantly, and take another shower. She doesn't have any clean clothes to wear, so she digs through my stuff to find something that isn't objectionable to her. I hold up the panties she left here and give a chuckle, but she decides to go commando, which is fine with me."How are you going to explain wearing my clothes when you get home?""I'll just tell the truth."My eyebrows go up, and she laughs."I'll just tell them I took a shower to get the sand and lotion off me and didn't want to put my dirty clothes back on, so you lent me some."I let out a deep breath and laughed, "Oh, that truth."We go to the taco stand to get some dinner on the way back to her place, and when we walk into the house, we see her parents, Nicole, and Jesse in the living room. All four turn to look at us, and Mr. Taylor doesn't look happy. <|endoftext|> Christina stands up, and we kiss, our tongues swirling around in each other's mouths. The taste of Nicole and my cum in her mouth drives me crazy. My cock is still hard, so I unbutton Christina's shorts and pull the zipper down, but she slaps my hand away."It's too soon," she warns."I don't care," I say. "I want you!""You'll have to wait."Nicole stands up, and Christina goes back to bathing my cock. Taking Nicole in my arms, I kiss her deeply. My hand grabs her tit, and I massage it, pinching her nipple between my fingers. I break the kiss and suck her nipple into my mouth, teasing it with my tongue.Christina pumps my cock while sucking on it frantically while massaging my balls, and I feel them tightening again."I'm going to come, Christina."She moans on my cock, which sends me over the edge, and I spray the inside of her mouth with my hot cum. White cream seeps from the corners of her lips as I fill her up. After licking every last drop of cum from my dick, Christina gets up and kneels behind Nicole, and pushes her into her former position against the wall. Christina puts two fingers in Nicole's pussy and pumps them in and out while her thumb presses against her clit. Using her shoulders to rest her body against the wall, Nicole reaches back and pulls her ass cheeks apart. Christina gets the hint and tongues Nicole's rosebud, pressing into her as far as she can go.Nicole's moaning gets louder, so I sit on the bench between Nicole and the wall. She lowers her head, and we kiss, hard, as Christina works on her. Nicole sucks my tongue into her mouth as she's moaning, and then her body stiffens and quivers before her legs give out. I'm glad I'm holding onto her, or else she'd be on the floor.Nicole is in my arms, trying to catch her breath when Christina kneels over her and kisses her. Christina then stands up and gives me a passionate kiss too. It's all I can do to keep myself under control around these two. They are insatiable. Christina finally pulls away and straightens her clothes before helping Nicole get dressed. They look in the mirror, fix their hair, and then walk out of the stall as if nothing happened.Christina says, "Think you can try that stuff on now?"I grin and try everything on, keeping what they like. We're walking to the register when Christina stops and pulls a pair of board shorts off the rack. She holds them up to me to see how they look."What do I need those for?" I ask."Get the green ones," Nicole says.Christina holds the green pair in front of me and looks me up and down, saying, "We're going to the beach tomorrow.""We are?""Yep, Nicole's driving."They add the green shorts to everything else and take it all to the register. Christina breaks out a credit card and gives it to the lady."My treat.""You guys can take me shopping anytime you want," I say with a huge smile.We leave the store and grab something to eat at the food court before Nicole parts ways with us.Christina and I go back to my apartment, and nobody's home, so we put the new clothes in the hamper, and then I push her onto my bed and lie on top of her. I look into her deep blue eyes and kiss her nose. She wraps her arms around my neck and her legs around my waist as we kiss again.She feels me stiffening and says, "I want you so bad right now.""You have me.""No! I WANT you, but we need to wait another day. Ugh," she says with a deep sigh."We don't have to wait. I don't care. I want to fuck you right now!""Eww! Too messy. We can wait."I try to roll off of her, but her legs hold me firm. I look at her again, and she has a soft smile, and her eyes glisten as her lips pucker a little. She seems so bussable, and I can't help myself, so I dive into her and lose myself in her love. I don't know how long we lie there kissing, but I'm fully hard and pressing into Christina's rocking mound when she moans and my shorts get wet. We stop. Panting heavily, I look at her beautiful face."How does it feel, knowing you can get me off just by kissing me?" I ask."Join the club," she replies with a big smile.She lets go of me, so I roll off to her side, and we lie there touching and caressing each other with our fingertips as we gaze into each other's eyes."It's late; I should probably go home," she says."What if I don't want you to go? Stay here with me.""Tempting. You don't know how tempting, but not tonight."I huff and get up, taking her by her hands and pulling her into my arms.She reaches up and kisses me on the nose, "C'mon, let's go before we get into trouble."After changing my shorts, I take her home and walk her to her door. When the door shuts, loneliness floods over me. It's as if there's a barrier to a void that I can't cross, and she's gone.We've only known each other for just under two months and have done so much with each other. We've gotten to know each other so well, and she's become an integral part of me. When she isn't with me, there's a deep emptiness in my soul that feels like the vacuum of space, and the more time I spend with her, the more difficult it is to be apart.Sunday, January 24thI dream of Christina sleeping with me. Having her next to me with her boobs pushing against my chest and her nose snuggled into my neck. I love holding her like this when we sleep. She drops her hand down and fondles my cock, making me hard. Leaning over, she engulfs my hard shaft into her warm, wet mouth. There is a delightful pressure being hard. Her lips touch mine as she kisses me...but wait...she's giving me a blowjob...another kiss...what? I slowly come out of the fog of sleep to see Christina leaning over me. She's smiling, and her eyes are aglow. I still feel a mouth and tongue in my groin, so I look down, and Nicole's there."See, I told you that'd wake him up," Christina says to Nicole. "C'mon sleepy head, get up. We're going to the beach, remember?""What? Wait! How?" I mutter, trying to figure out what's going on. Then, as the fuzz clears, I remember it's Sunday, and they said we're going to the beach...the beach. I sit up as Nicole releases me from her mouth, and I swing my legs to the floor, wiping the sand from my eyes. I focus on the blur to find Christina and Nicole standing there in t-shirts and shorts. It suddenly hits me that Christina is in my apartment, and I know I locked the door last night."C'mon, get up!" Christina says. "Get your suit on so we can go.""Wait. How'd you get in here?" I ask."Your key, remember? You told me to make a copy of it so I could come here and study while I waited for you to come home from practice.""Oh...yeah. I forgot."I stand up and reach for my new swim trunks when Nicole says, "He should probably shower first. He's a little musty downstairs."Christina and Nicole pull me up and lead me to the bathroom. The quick shower helps me wake up, so I get out, dry off, and get in the swimsuit Christina bought for me. I open the closet to look for a beach towel when they pull me by the arms and tell me they already have everything we need. So, I slip on my thongs, grab my wallet and keys, and follow them out the door. They ask me to drive so I won't have to sit in the back, and Christina can sit next to me.We get to the car, and Jesse's in the back seat. "Took you guys long enough!""We had to wake him up, and he needed a shower," Nicole replies.Nicole and Jesse are in the back giggling and whispering almost all the way to the beach while Christina sits next to me, rubbing her hand up and down my leg. I look at her, and she smiles, knowing the effect she's having on me.When we get there, we find a somewhat secluded area on the sand. There are more people here than I thought there'd be in January, but it's been hot in the Valley, and people need relief.Usually, when I go to the beach, I just bring a towel, sunscreen, and a smile but not these ladies. They've brought an umbrella, beach chairs, and towels along with all the essentials of a successful day. They even packed lunch and a cooler full of sodas and water. It seems they have everything but the kitchen sink.They peel their shirts and shorts from their bodies, exposing their bikinis, and I try not to have lewd thoughts about them. How'd I get so lucky to be at the beach with these hot babes?Nicole's suit I've seen before, but her bottoms seem skimpier than I remember. The little triangle barely covers her camel toe, and the thin string up her ass completes the view.I've never seen Christina in a bikini before, and man is she sexy. She too has three small triangles, but her suit is white and, in my imagination, see-through. I'd love to see that suit wet! The sight of her makes me hunger for...no...crave her.I look over at Jesse, and she's smokin' hot. She has more material and fills it out spectacularly, looking like a goddess to be worshipped. Her breasts push her top out, and her nipples make large imprints that tempt me to suck on them. I shake my head and remember she's not my girlfriend, and I shouldn't have these types of thoughts about her. She isn't wearing a thong, but her bottoms are a thin piece of material that's tied at her hips. The fabric begins a few inches below her belly button, travels under her pussy, and back up her ass. She turns around to wipe sand from her butt cheeks, showing me a perfect "V" of material that clings in her crack.My bulge pushes hard against my shorts as I ogle these sex idols. It's a good thing I'm their friend because otherwise, they'd probably have me arrested for leering at them.Christina puts sunscreen on me and then asks Nicole if she wants some too. She does and turns over on her stomach. Christina kneels over her and undoes Nicole's top to massage Nicole's back with lotion. Christina's hands linger on the sides of Nicole's boobs, so she leans up on her elbows to give Christina better access. Christina cups Nicole's tits and pinches her nipples while leaning down on her and nibbling her earlobe. Nicole moans and raises her ass in the air, pushing against Christina.Christina turns around and focuses on Nicole's lower half, untying Nicole's bottoms on the sides and pushing what material there is between her legs. Nicole spreads her legs out, and Christina squirts some lotion on her cheeks and down her crack. Nicole squeals at the cold and shakes her ass. Christina rubs the cream into Nicole's skin, running her fingers down her crack before cupping her pussy. Christina then applies sunscreen to Nicole's legs and tells her to turn over.Jesse's wide-eyed as she looks on attentively; apparently, this is the first time she's seen these two together like this.Christina scoots up and kneels over Nicole's waist, and leans down, kissing her. She squeezes lotion on each of Nicole's tits and then massages it in, paying particular attention to her nipples. Christina finishes applying sunscreen to the rest of Nicole's body and then asks her to return the favor.Christina lies face down on her towel while Nicole puts her suit back on and kneels over Christina. When Nicole gets to her ass, Christina spreads her legs and pushes her cheeks into the air. Nicole slides her fingers between Christina's folds, which elicits a long moan and some hip rocking. Nicole finishes her back and tells Christina to turn over. She removes Christina's top and massages her torso with the cream, but before getting anything on her tits, she leans down and sucks a nipple into her mouth, flicking it with her tongue. Then, she spreads sunscreen over Christina's breasts while pinching and pulling on her nipples.By this time, Jesse's mouth has dropped open, and she looks stunned by the show.Nicole finishes by leaning over and kissing Christina deeply before sitting up and looking over at Jesse."How about you? Would you like some too?" Nicole asks.Jesse comes out of her trance, and her voice cracks when she answers, "Uh...well...uhm...okay."Nicole moves over to Jesse while she turns over onto her stomach. She sits on her ass and unties her top before she spreads sunscreen on her back. She works the cream into Jesse's shoulder muscles and runs her hands up and down the sides of Jesse's torso before turning around to squeeze some on Jesse's cheeks."How do you want your butt done?" Nicole asks. "Want me to undo your bottoms, so I don't get any on your suit?"Uhm...yeah, I guess."Nicole unties the sides of Jesse's bottoms and sets the material between her legs to make it easier to work on her cheeks. She squirts a little in her crack and creeps her fingers slowly downward, waiting to see how Jesse responds. Jesse lifts her hips, and that's all the invitation Nicole needs to continue down...all the way down.Nicole turns her head towards us and mouths the words, "Very wet."Jesse moans loudly as she raises her hips further and spreads her legs wider. Nicole keeps constant attention on Jesse's sex until she groans out a very loud moan and her legs tremble. Finally, Nicole turns back around and slides down to Jesse's feet while telling her to turn over. She rolls over and covers herself with her hands as her top falls off."Don't be shy," Nicole says. "Tom's already seen you, and Christina and I have our own."Jesse looks over at us and lets her hands fall to her side. Nicole takes her finger, slides it under the triangle hiding Jesse's bush, and works her finger around Jesse's clit until she rocks her hips. Next, Nicole pulls the front of her bottoms down and slides in between her legs, causing them to spread further.Nicole sucks on Jesse's swelling labia, which causes Jesse to gasp while she puts her hand on the back of Nicole's head, grabbing her hair. Nicole works two fingers into her and presses up into Jesse's g-spot while she licks and sucks on her clit. Jesse is rocking her hips now and almost screaming. Her breaths get shallow, and she arches her back before relaxing with a deep sigh. Nicole gets up and spreads sunscreen on Jesse's torso and works it in, making sure to give ample attention to her boobs. Nicole pulls on Jesse's nipples and pinches them between her slippery fingers. Jesse moans some more, so Nicole leans down and gives her a light kiss on the lips."There, all done," Nicole says."In more ways than one," Jesse pants. "That was amazing, I've never had anyone go down on me before, and I never dreamed that a woman would do that to me.""Never? Well, it's new for Christina and me too, and if she ever lets Tom do that for you," she continues, "you're in for a real treat."I'm rock hard after watching that, and my cock strains severely against my shorts. Christina leans over, takes my bulge in her hands, and rubs it up and down. She goes to lower my shorts, but I stop her and nod towards Jesse."Jesse?" Christina asks. "Tom's in a little pain here. Would you mind if I relieve it in front of you?"Her eyes widen again as she says, "Uh, no. I guess not. Especially with what's already happened."Christina removes my trunks, and I'm completely naked on the beach with my boner sticking straight up. She takes me in her mouth and gives me one hell of a blowjob in front of her friends. When she achieves her goal, she leans over to Nicole and shares my spent cum with her. I soften a little but know I'm going to get hard again watching Christina and Nicole, so I tell the girls I'm going for a swim, and Nicole dares me to skinny dip."Are you kidding? Walk around naked on a public beach?""Go on, just do it," Christina urges."Oh, come on," Nicole says. "There's hardly anyone here. I triple dog dare you.""You dare me? What if the patrol comes by and arrests me for indecent exposure?""We'll talk them out of it," Christina says.It's futile to argue with them, so I shrug, stand up, and walk to the water, looking around to see if anyone notices me. There really aren't that many people here, and those I can see are in their own worlds, so I don't worry about it and jump in the water.It's so cold, my penis retracts into my body like a scared turtle, and my balls pull up, searching for some warmth.

Their mouths drop open when they notice I'm naked.Christina leans over to kiss me as she grabs my cock and massages it, bringing it back out in the open. Nicole's on the other side of me, and she also leans over, and we share a three-way kiss as she grabs on to me too. With the two of them kissing and fondling me, the turtle comes out of its shell proudly. We stop what we're doing, and I look up at the three guys whose chins have dropped further than before.

I whisper."I love you too."She sits up and picks up her pace, and I let her go awhile before I roll us over, putting her on the bottom. I have my weight on my elbows as I look at her."I've missed this so much!" I say with a deep yearning in my voice."Me too."I feel her urgency and plunge into her. She grunts as she meets my thrusts and pushes against me. I stop and then press deep inside her before slowly pulling myself almost all the way out and then drive back into her. Her eyebrows furrow as she moans, and I repeat this until the pace is furious. I slow my breathing as I plunge into her and her body tenses."Ready?" I pant."Re...ad...y...," she groans.I push deep and do mini-thrusts as my silk surges into her. She yells, groans, and moans, all at the same time.

Driving in deep one last time, I hold myself there until her breathing becomes steady, and she relaxes. Her face is peaceful, and her warm smile returns. Her eyes twinkle and glisten as I look into them. We kiss again, deeply, as we lie there motionless, feeling our hearts beat rapidly and our beads of sweat mingle. I soften and slip out of her as we turn on our sides, holding each other tight. I eventually roll on my back, and she puts her leg over me, resting her head on my chest.We lie there, peaceful and quiet. It's moments like this that I never want to end. Never ever. I look at the clock, and it's seven. I sigh deeply as I tell her the time. We get up, reluctantly, and take another shower. She doesn't have any clean clothes to wear, so she digs through my stuff to find something that isn't objectionable to her. I hold up the panties she left here and give a chuckle, but she decides to go commando, which is fine with me."How are you going to explain wearing my clothes when you get home?""I'll just tell the truth."My eyebrows go up, and she laughs."I'll just tell them I took a shower to get the sand and lotion off me and didn't want to put my dirty clothes back on, so you lent me some."I let out a deep breath and laughed, "Oh, that truth."We go to the taco stand to get some dinner on the way back to her place, and when we walk into the house, we see her parents, Nicole, and Jesse in the living room. All four turn to look at us, and Mr. Taylor doesn't look happy.
