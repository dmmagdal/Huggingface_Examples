The landscape flying past the bus consisted of nothing, but flat fields that stretched to the horizon. She found herself idly wondering if the fields had already been harvested, or if there was some lonely flock of sheep or herd of cattle hidden somewhere in that endless expanse.The bus began slowing, interrupting the hum of wheels on asphalt for the first time in many hours. The change electrified the passengers as heads along the length of the bus leaned into the aisle to see what had liberated them from their tedium.Ahead of the bus was a massive chain-link fence that seemed to grow in height with each passing moment. The sight of it filled the passengers with a sense of dread, whispering began about what kind of school had a fence like a prison. The bus continued to slow, finally stopping at a small hut by the side of the road. Raven was too far back in the bus to hear what their driver was saying but she offered up a silent prayer that their driver had made a mistake and they would be sent away. Unfortunately, it went unanswered and the bus soon continued towards the now towering fence.They passed through a sliding gate in the fence, entering a security airlock where a man in uniform circled around the bus, pausing to look underneath the vehicle. Raven tilted her head as she looked out the window, the fence surrounded the bus to a height of almost four stories with a y-shaped peak that would prevent anyone climbing the fence from entering or leaving. The security guard finished his careful sweep of the bus, before they were allowed to pass through another gate and into the facility beyond.Faces were pressed to windows along the length of the bus, as Raven and the rest of the passengers gazed out at the world they'd just entered. They were approaching a series of two- and three-story buildings built in the modern style of crisp white and shiny black walls, straight edges, and floor to ceiling windows. The bus turned slightly, heading into a courtyard in front of the central building and Raven glimpsed a figure standing in the courtyard, as the bus came to a halt and the engine stopped. A collective sigh went up from the bus as they experienced motionless for the first time in many hours. The front door of the bus opened with a pneumatic hiss and a figure moved quickly up the stairs, shaking the driver's hand before taking position just behind the driver.She was a tall, thin woman in her mid-thirties with bronzed skin and long blonde hair that rested gently on large breasts. She had a gorgeous body that was only enhanced by the tight-fitting white blouse and dark skirt she was wearing. Raven stared enraptured at the woman for what felt like whole minutes, before wondering if maybe she'd spent too long on the bus."Hi ladies," the woman said, revealing a loving smile and slight British accent. "I'm Ms Smith and I'll be one of your teachers here. We're going to have a short assembly to get you all orientated in just a few minutes. For now feel free to hop off the bus and relax, bathrooms are just inside the doors to your right." She turned and pointed at the nearby set of sliding doors and what looked like a reception area. When Ms Smith turned back, a hand towards the front of the bus was up."Ms Smith, where are we?" a voiced asked.Ms Smith paused a second, before turning to the questioner, "Everything will be explained in the assembly, including any questions you have. Short answer, a new school for you ladies." With that answered, Ms Smith hopped off the bus before any other questions could be asked.Raven stood up from her seat feeling stiff and joined the queue of people following Ms Smith out of the bus. Leaving the bus she was hit by a blast of cool, fresh air and Raven stood still for a few seconds enjoying both, before looking around at the rest of her fellow travellers. Despite sharing an enclosed space with them for so many hours, none of them had really interacted with each other; the driver had been quick to shout down even the mildest hint of noise. Raven had turned eighteen, months ago and as far as she could see, everyone else was a girl around her same age, maybe slightly older.She walked over to a group of girls, regardless of Ms Smith's use of the term ladies Raven still considered herself a girl. Most of the group were doing simple stretches, lunges, and one was pulling a leg up behind her back. A few were taking it easier and simply walking around to get the blood flowing again. Raven preferred to put the effort in, bending at the waist and stretching out her arms to reach for her toes.On the far side of the courtyard, separated by a fence from Raven's group, a second bus had arrived and after a presumably similar speech from Ms Smith, was beginning to unload its occupants. Raven continued stretching for a good minute, bending as far as she could whilst shifting her weight from foot to foot and wiggling her hips to loosen them up; letting the blood rush to her head before slowly raising her arms and straightening her back.As the other girls re-entered her view, she was surprised to see she'd become the centre of attention. She felt her face begin to flush as she looked over herself to see what had grabbed their attention, sliding a hand along her backside to find any tear in her skirt. A noise grabbed her attention and she spun around to identify the source. A group of young boys, men her own age really, were lined up along the fence, most were staring approvingly at her while a few broke into applause. Her face became red and her head began to spin, breathing going into overdrive as she realised the show she'd been putting on for the audience. She turned away and walked past the stretching group as quickly as her legs would carry her to take shelter behind the bus.A few of the more adventurous girls decided to take advantage of the moment to become the new centres of attention. One began stretching their back inwards as a thinly veiled excuse to stick out her chest. Another quiet, flexible girl was lifting a leg above their head to allow a small glimpse of panty to the enthusiastic audience.Raven made sure she was out of view before letting out a deep breath and resting against the side of the bus, eyes closed in horror. A girl, Raven hadn't noticed before, walked up slowly with a friendly smile and leaned next to her. This new girl was in many ways the opposite of Raven, with long, curly brown hair, wide hips and breasts that were easily in the D-cup range. Raven had often thought of herself as a late bloomer, though she had long since stopped 'developing', as her mother put it. She had short black hair angled to one side and was skinny. She still struggled to completely fill the AA-cup bras her mother had bought her in the early years of high school. Raven was wearing her usual loose fitting, pink polo shirt; a knee length dark blue skirt; and a small, pink bow in her hair. The new girl was showing off her figure with a sleeveless top that stopped just below her belly button exposing a thin stretch of flawless skin above her tight-fitting jeans."They can't help themselves, can they?" the girl asked, gesturing at the girls now holding arms behind their heads and jumping, bouncing was probably the more appropriate term, to the delight of their audience. "I'm Cassandra, but call me Cassie" she added, maintaining the friendly smile."I'm Raven; and I wasn't exactly bringing glory to the sisterhood, either.""You were fine," Cassie responded reassuringly, "nothing wrong with showing off the goods," she added, slowly waving a hand over her body. "It's all about what you're revealing."Raven didn't really want to think about what she'd just revealed to a pack of horny boys.Cassie saw the face Raven was making and her smile widened, "You showed them you have a good ass and you're not a slut, if you'll pardon my French, unlike some ladies I can think of." She used the maximum possible amount of sarcasm on the word, ladies.Raven laughed nervously, but felt herself begin to relax. "My ass doesn't compare to Ms Smith's," she finally countered.It was Cassie's turn to laugh. "I know right!" she said, with the enthusiasm of an expert commentator, "and did you see those boobs? sure puts mine to shame!" She cupped her own breasts, pushing them up to try to replicate the physique."I'm an F, but only just," Ms Smith said as she walked up to them, having suddenly appeared around the corner of the bus, "but, I've always thought my ass could use some work."Raven and Cassie looked sheepish, but Ms Smith moved away from the pair without further comment, heading towards the doors to the building. "Alright everyone," she announced, holding up a hand for attention. "Please follow me and we'll move to the assembly hall now." She waited a second for everyone to start moving before heading through the door and into the building.Raven walked with Cassie through the glass doorway and down a hallway behind Ms Smith, looking around as they walked through the building. It was new and unused; the walls were smooth and white, while the floor was a dark grey carpet that had been relentlessly vacuumed in preparation for their arrival. Signs on doors and glimpses through windows indicated they were passing classrooms, computer and science labs, a gym, infirmary and a teacher's lounge. They arrived at a set of double doors that Ms Smith held open for the rest to pass through. "Just sit on the right side please," she said, as they passed into the hall.The hall was large enough to seat hundreds of students, but today there were only a few rows of temporary seating at the front, split evenly in the middle. Raven took a seat next to Cassie in the front row, looking at an empty stage as they waited for the rest of the group to take their seats. Looking back, Raven noticed that the doors were already closed, evidently the boys from the other bus were not going to be joining them.The quiet chatter was suddenly silenced, and as Raven turned back to face the stage she saw a man walking across the stage. He was tall and reasonably fit, with short brown hair. Raven thought he looked middle-aged, though that translated to early thirties at most. He was wearing a pair of silver framed glasses, black pants, and a grey short-sleeve shirt, with the whole look topped off by a headset microphone.The hall darkened and the faint hum of a projector fan started as a crisp photo of their building was projected onto a screen that had been lowered onto the stage, below the image were the words ALBERT-03 TEST SCHOOL. "Good morning, ladies" the man began, speaking with an accent that Raven couldn't place. "Welcome to the Albert zero-three test school" he continued. "I hope you're all feeling okay from the trip, I know the commute is long."The trip had taken the better part of two days, and Raven hadn't seen anything she would even consider a town since late on the first day."I'd like to begin this assembly with a bit of a history lesson and then I'll go through the structure here before I answer any questions." He continued, using a device in his hand to change the projection to an image of a pair of young people smiling in graduation robes. "Forty years ago, the education system of this country was a respected institution with a ninety-eight percent success rate in educating young people to a passing grade at the end of their school program. Well over half of those students would then go on to finish a university-level program. That's more than nine out of every ten students who entered pre-school, successfully completing their education, and almost fifty percent of all students going on to complete a university degree." He paused to change the slide to a downward trending graph."For almost the entirety of the last four decades that statistic has been dropping. Ten years ago, the typical student had a less than fifty percent chance of passing their end-of-year exams, with only ten percent of students completing a university degree." He was emphasizing each statistic as he went to drive home the point. "Six years ago, it was decided to extend the time a student spent in school, with the age for final exams moving from eighteen years to twenty-one years old." He made a hand gesture and the declining curve was extended, showing a brief climb before once again resuming a downwards trend."This only had a temporary effect and the decline in education standards continued. As a result, the government has decided to re-evaluate the entire education system." He changed slides to show a map, dotted with multiple black circles with 01 to 08 written above them.Raven was falling asleep, she'd heard similar speeches from her father, a principal at their local high school who'd made similar remarks over the dinner table. She realised with frustration that she'd missed the chance to visit the bathroom before the presentation and was regretting her choice as she crossed her legs tightly.As the man changed the slide and carried on speaking, Raven realized she hadn't heard his name yet. "This facility was originally destined to be a new Department of Corrections rehabilitation facility, their fancy name for prison," he said. The fence around the building suddenly made a lot more sense and there was a murmur of discontent from the assembly hall. The man on stage gave them a few seconds, before holding up both hands for silence. "Fortunately for everyone here, they only managed to complete the perimeter fencing before the area was handed over to us for use as an experimental test school. I know it sounds bad, but rest assured, this is a school," he said, emphasizing school. "The designers worked hard to provide a quality educational facility here."His face changed to an embarrassed smile, as he switched to the next slide with an enlarged image of his own face with an obscenely friendly smile. "If you've ever had difficulty with public speaking, you should try having to make one of these," he said with a small laugh. "My name is Dr William Clark and my role here is Headmaster of the facility, but I'll also be one of your teachers. I have a background in science and engineering. I've been lecturing at universities for slightly over eight years and I've been working in a consultant role with various organizations for the last five years.""Almost two years ago, I was invited by the government, along with hundreds of other participants to submit a proposal for an educational program that would address the declining educational levels. My proposal came in third and as a result I now have the privilege to welcome you to the Albert-Zero-Three Test School" He paused but Raven could see he was excited, even if his audience were already losing focus again. "For those of you still paying attention, I'd like to go over a brief overview of what the structure here is and how I'll be helping you get through the last few years of your education," he looked at his audience. "For those of you not paying attention..." he quietly inhaled and pulled the microphone closer to his mouth..."OI!" he shouted.Raven flinched at the sudden change in volume, as did most of the assembly. Behind her, a girl who'd actually dozed was startled awake, banging into the back of Raven's chair before almost falling into the aisle.Mr Clark looked amused at the reaction he'd caused and saw his opportunity. "Thank you for volunteering young lady," he pointed as he spoke, and Raven was terrified he meant her, before realising he was after the girl behind her. "Can you please come on stage."The girl hesitated, but Mr Clark wasn't looking at the audience as he walked to fetch something from off stage; and she had no option, but to slowly make her way to the stage.Raven could see she was a thin girl, with long black hair. She was wearing a pink shirt and a pair of tight jean shorts that were short enough they didn't quite cover the entire curve of the girl's bottom. The girl put on her best confident smile as she walked up the stairs. Mr Clark had returned to the centre of the stage holding a box in his hands. He gestured at the girl to join him in the middle of the stage, handing her the box."You are Ms--" he paused as he tried to put a name to the face, "Ms Margrie, correct?"The girl smiled and nodded, "Heather Margrie.""I hope you had a nice nap, Ms Margrie."Raven watched as the smile twitched, before increasing in intensity."It was lovely, thanks," Heather answered, trying a flutter of eyelashes while locking eyes with Mr Clark to put him on the defensive.Mr Clark was evidently unfazed and moved on with his presentation. The projector clicked and a new slide showed a graph with a series of rising lines."Ladies, my proposal for your educational program was based on two observations, the first being this graph." He waved an arm towards the projected image, "This shows the rise in the consumption of pornographic materials by people your age."The hall was silent, Heather was struggling to maintain her innocent smile in front of the assembly.Mr Clark continued, "The second was an analysis of the causes behind every expulsion, suspension, and other disciplinary action taken against people your age for the last twenty years." He turned back to Heather, "Ms Margrie, can you please explain why you were expelled from your last school."Heather was evidently uncomfortable with the question, she was also put off by Mr Clark's constant use of her last name. She hesitated, trying to think of a way out before reluctantly speaking."I slept with my science teacher." The smile stayed on her face, though it seemed to lose a lot of its innocence.Raven felt a chill, as she began to realise why she'd been selected for this school.Mr Clark was evidently unsatisfied with the answer and waved his hand for her to go on. Heather didn't speak, dropping the cheery smile."You had sex with your teacher and filmed it Ms Margrie; you then blackmailed him into giving you a passing grade." Mr Clark was evidently fully aware of what had occurred, and Heather blushed at being so publicly exposed. Mr Clark turned from her to face the audience."As I said, this school is about finding a way to reverse the declining levels of education and I believe this problem has come about, in part, because of the rising levels of enthusiasm for sex among the youth." The entire audience shifted uncomfortably and tried to avoid eye contact."I know," he continued, "that none of you young ladies are virgins. That was a very deliberate choice on our part. We needed students with the right background, to help explore if my proposal for education with a sexual reinforcement structure will help you all improve your academic performance."Heather was finding it harder to maintain any kind of aloof demeanour as she shifted uncomfortably."Now, I don't want you to think that I'm singling out poor Ms Margrie here. All of you, every single student in this room, failed to complete your education. In every one of your cases, your sexual activity was a determining, if not the deciding, factor. We have in this room, more than one student who tried to blackmail through sex," he gestured at Heather, "a student who failed to attend more than half their classes because they were using the school storeroom for sexual endurance events. One of you is a quite famous cam-girl; and one of you was caught in the gent's bathroom, legs wrapped around your boyfriend in the middle of one of your most important exams."Raven shifted uncomfortably and her stomach dropped. She tried to make herself invisible, but only ended up feeling like she was making herself more obvious. The hall was filled with an uncomfortable silence, and Mr Clark turned back to a nervous Heather, before quickly checking his watch. "I had hoped our guest would arrive by now, but we'll keep things moving," he said, with a small clap of his hands. "Ms Margrie can you please open the box and take out the topmost item."All eyes were locked on the stage as Heather examined the box like she'd just been told it was a bomb, trying to hold it carefully at the maximum possible distance. She eventually found the latch and lifted the lid slowly away from her, blocking the audience's view. Raven heard the faint metallic clink of two pieces of metal colliding as Heather pulled something out.It was a shiny belt of some kind, though as Heather extracted it from the box, a new section attached to the belt appeared. Heather realised what it was and her mouth opened, Mr Clark saw the recognition and gestured for her to explain what it was."It's--" Heather tried, but couldn't bring herself to say anything further. Mr Clark gave her a few seconds to try to bring herself together, but the thought was still too much for her."What Ms Margrie is holding is known as a chastity belt" Mr Clark finally said, before holding out his hand for Heather to hand it over, which she eagerly did. "And it's going to be the first of many tools and techniques we'll be trialling at this school." He was showing it off, locking and unlocking the sections together. "Now these are a top-of-the-line design, so you'll get about a week of wear out of them before they need to be changed, and they'll have no impact on your use of the bathroom. They even have padding built in so you'll quickly forget you're wearing them. We really spared no expense on these items, so treat them well."There was whispering from the audience and Raven turned to look at Cassie, who was staring fixedly at the belt. Mr Clark had to raise his hands and wait for the noise to die down."I know you'll have some questions," he said, checking his watch again, "but our guest still hasn't arrived, so we'll give Ms Margrie a break and let her go. I was hoping to use her to provide a demonstration of the belt and some of the other tools, but we'll have to wait. Can you all please give Ms Margrie a round of applause for her assistance today while she returns to her seat."If ever a girl had been delivered by a higher power, they would've had the same look of relief as Heather Margrie. Mr Clark took the box from her, carefully putting the belt inside before closing the lid. He then put a hand on her shoulder and walked her gently to the stairs. He then ducked behind the curtains as Heather took her seat and the quiet applause stopped. When Mr Clark returned, he was carrying a plastic tub."Alright everyone, Ms Smith will take you all to the showers where you can freshen up from your trip. Each of you will be provided with one of these tubs with a uniform in your size, please make sure you get the tub with your name on it. These uniforms are not going to be mandatory for your entire stay here, but they will be a requirement during learning hours. Please put your normal clothes back in the tub and they'll be returned to you this evening along with your luggage on the bus" He took a breath and looked at the back of the hall to confirm Ms Smith had returned. "Each tub contains a chastity belt that's been assigned to you. If you've managed to wear underwear before, you can figure out how to put these on, but Ms Smith will be there to answer any questions. Put them on," he paused to emphasize the instruction, "and make sure you secure them by closing the lock and handing the key to Ms Smith. There's only one key per belt so if you lose it, you'll find yourself having an unpleasant stay here." He paused, thinking of what else he needed to say before allowing them to leave."Thank you all for paying attention so far, I'll go over the program when you return and I'll answer as many questions as I can. The first few days will be mostly orientation, so please don't stress if you miss a chance to ask a question." He took a breath before stretching out his hands to let Ms Smith take over.The girls left the assembly hall and followed Ms Smith down a corridor. None of them willing to speak about what they'd just seen. They passed through another pair of doors into large gymnasium, before entering a changing room where a small table had been set up. Ms Smith assumed her position behind the table before indicating the girls should form a single line in front.Raven took advantage of the bathroom, ending up at the back of the line and forced to wait as Ms Smith methodically went through the tubs, checking each girl's name on a list and handing them a corresponding tub. Raven's mind kept going back to the sight of the belt in Mr Clark's hands as he pointed to the various features. When she reached the front of the queue Ms Smith gave her a warm smile and asked for her name."Raven Thompson" she answered, nervousness obvious in her voice.Ms Smith went down the length of the list with her finger and put a check mark against her name, before reaching over and grabbing a tub."Showers are behind you, there's a small changing section with a towel and toiletries in each cubicle so you can freshen up. Once you're clean you can change into the uniform and put everything else back in the tub, just make sure you keep the key to the belt separate and hand it back to me." Ms Smith passed over the tub, which Raven timidly accepted.She walked down the tiled floor of the changeroom, passing rows of open cubicles. With a realisation that nearly made her drop the tub, she saw that while each cubicle had solid walls to the floor, none of them had any doors.She walked carefully between the cubicles, trying carefully to see if any were free while also not looking at the semi-nude to outright naked figures who occupied almost all of them. She finally reached a row of empty cubicles near the rear and decided after a second to take the cubicle on the left. Apart from the notable missing door, the design was a typical camping ground shower cubicle, with a forward changing and rear shower section. She put the tub on the small bench, next to a few bottles of soap and hair products, with a hook above supporting a clean white towel.With a deep sigh she opened the lid of the tub. Lying immediately on top was the chastity belt, resting in a velvet lined case with a clear cover to show off the belt within. She looked around embarrassed, even though no one was around to see her before deciding to have the shower before dealing with the tub.She took the towel from the hook and folded it neatly on the bench as close to the shower as possible, before moving the bottles of soap and shampoo into the floor of the shower area. She looked across and saw Cassie entering the cubicle opposite her.Raven watched as Cassie opened her own tub and saw the belt lying on top, blushing a little as she opened the case and took it out for closer inspection. Cassie held it up to the light, inspecting it from every angle before lowering it in front of her crotch, visualising how it would fit. She finally looked at Raven and raised an eyebrow, before tossing it back into the tub.Raven started to strip down, removing each item of clothing carefully and folding them as she went. As she began to lay her clothes on the bench she caught sight of the belt at the top of the open tub and shuddered, before closing the tub and putting all her clothes on top to bury it.In the other cubicle, Raven saw Cassie was stripping down, though her motions seemed far smoother, as she tossed her discarded items of clothing aside. Raven looked at the curvy body opposite and compared it to her own petite frame with embarrassment. She could fight the feeling down when comparing herself to women like Ms Smith, thinking that in some vague future she would have a body like that, but here was a student with a gorgeous body, large breasts and wide hips who didn't have to wait.Raven looked away before Cassie could catch her gawking, and started the shower, the water was hot and Raven enjoyed the sting as she washed the stiffness out of her body. The soap was a generic brand, but it smelled nice and Raven scrubbed away at the accumulated grime from two days of travel. She finished washing at the same time as Cassie and the two walked towards each other for a second as they exited the shower, and for a second, Raven thought she saw a twitch of a smile from Cassie, but it was probably just in her head.Raven dried herself off, careful not to knock her clothes off the tub, before hanging the towel back on the hook. She looked at the tub, staring in the hope it might change contents if she just willed it enough. Unfortunately, it hadn't and she found herself staring at the belt again as she moved her clothes and opened the tub. She went to reach for it, but stopped and brought her arm back. She wasn't afraid of it, at least she didn't think fear was the right word, was she embarrassed by it? She finally settled on humiliated. Humiliated at the idea of being forced to wear a metal belt over a private part of her body. Humiliated that a stranger would hold the literal key to parts of her.She finally worked up the courage to pick up the case, and after a brief struggle with the clasp, take out the belt. The first thing she noticed was the weight. It was surprisingly heavy, maybe even a full kilogram of metal. She turned it around, inspecting it. There were two loops of metal, both with spongy padding wherever they were designed to touch skin. The waist band was only a few centimetres wide and felt cool to the touch, though keeping against a body would heat it up quickly. On one side of the waistband was a lock, not much bigger than the belt, but with curved edges to avoid digging into flesh. It had an engraved serial number, to identify lock and key. A central strap joined the belt in two places, wider than the waistband and designed to go between her legs and firmly against the body. There were perforations in two places, though which way they went on wasn't immediately clear.Cassie spent longer drying off thanks to her long hair and turned to see her neighbour staring at the belt and looking overwhelmed."Psst," she whispered, trying to get Raven's attention but without success. "Raven," she whispered again, clicking her fingers and getting Raven's attention. Cassie nodded at the belt in Raven's hand before shaking her head, but Raven's didn't understand the message."They can't make you wear it" Cassie whispered, though as she checked down the aisle Ms Smith was still at the front of the room and couldn't possibly hear her."What?" Raven whispered back, instinctively mirroring Cassie's secrecy."No way they can make us wear a chastity belt, they can't force us to wear it if we don't want to."Raven considered herself a polite and well-behaved girl who never broke the rules except, she thought, for the day that had brought her here. She would look back later and wonder why she made the choice she did, eventually deciding on a mixture of a desire to appear cool in front of a much cooler girl and her own desire to avoid that feeling of humiliation every time she shifted her hips."You?" she asked back.Cassie shook her head and tossed the belt back in the tub, before thinking it through. She carefully emptied the uniform from the tub, placing a layer of her own clothes in, before grabbing the belt. She held it in her hands for a few seconds before realising the key was still in the packet. Removing the key she tossed the belt and the packet deep into the tub before burying it under the rest of her clothes, keeping the key in her hand.Raven worked out what she was doing, carefully removing the rest of the school uniform and hiding the chastity belt amongst her own clothing. She kept the key separate as she added the packet to the tub before closing it up. She shared a conspiratorial smile with Cassie before turning to change into the new uniform.The uniform consisted of a blouse, skirt, tie and white underwear. Raven got the underwear on and was surprised at how comfortably they fit her. She remembered the forms she'd spent hours filling out before coming to the school and tried to recall if they'd asked about underwear sizes. The blouse was white with short sleeves and buttons running up the entire length of the middle that caused Raven no end of frustration as she struggled to get them all buttoned up.The skirt was a patterned black and white affair that stopped exactly halfway down her thighs, slightly higher than she would have preferred, but not as bad as the one she'd worn during her high school years that had threatened to expose her with every gust of wind, or careless bend of the waist. The tie was the same plaid pattern as the skirt and was a first for Raven, who had to get Cassie to show her how to tie it around her neck.Looking back at the bench she saw that the shoes, with socks bundled inside had fallen behind the tub and she quickly added black socks and shoes to her new ensemble. She thought briefly about the bow she wore in her hair and decided she'd wear it until she was told otherwise, it was a tiny bit of colour her mother had given her that always brought joy.She and Cassie checked each other out, evaluating the look they couldn't see on themselves since the cubicles lacked mirrors. It wasn't a bad look Raven had to admit, she'd often felt school uniforms made the wearer look juvenile, but she didn't feel bad about this. The shirt managed to look professional, though slightly enhancing the curves on her opposite and showing off her own lack of them. The skirt had two thin pockets and her blouse had a single pocket on the left breast and she silently thanked the designer for incorporating a long-desired feature.They walked together back to Ms Smith, arms carrying the tubs with the belts concealed inside. Having entered at the back of the line they'd finished changing later than the rest of the girls and walked past empty cubicles. As they approached Ms Smith, Cassie slowed to allow Raven to go first, though Raven would have preferred to stay behind her. She worried the guilt was written on her face as she placed the tub on the table."All finished?" Ms Smith looked her over to confirm the uniform was in place. She paused briefly at the bow but didn't say anything and returned to scanning, getting embarrassingly low.Raven squeezed her legs together as the gaze reached her thighs, trying to conceal what was already hidden by the skirt, before responding with a small, "All done."Ms Smith checked the name on the tub and ticked it off her checklist for a second time. She held out her hand and Raven took a second to realise what she was after before she placed the key in Ms Smith's hand."Everything go okay getting the belt on?""All good," Raven said just a little too quickly before adding "heavier than I expected."Ms Smith nodded thoughtfully, "You'll get used to it."Not while it's in the tub Raven thought, as she was allowed to walk out of the changing room empty handed. A small feeling of guilt nestling in the back of her mind as she thought about the lie she'd just gotten away with. She saw the rest of her new classmates in matching outfits sitting against the wall in small groups. Deciding that she'd rather wait for Cassie she took a few steps to the side and stood waiting for her friend to exit. Cassie and Ms Smith exited the changeroom after a minute or so and the entire group was summoned to stand up and return to the assembly hall.They all returned to the assembly hall, again limiting their seating to just the right half. Raven sat at the back this time, she'd lost track of Cassie during the shuffle and was now stuck sitting next to a tall blonde girl.The stage had a new occupant, an elderly man with a receding hairline and a thin grey beard. He was standing off to the side and holding a clipboard that was evidently more interesting than the roomful of students. Mr Clark, Headmaster, Raven reminded herself walked back on the stage as Ms Smith walked down the stairs and left the hall. He took a brief look around the hall, scanning each row before resuming his presentation."Welcome back ladies, you're all looking very nice in your uniforms. I'd like you to meet our esteemed guest, Mr O'Brien." The old man looked up from his clipboard and nodded but otherwise remained motionless."Mr O'Brien is going to be an evaluator for the school, assessing how well your studies are progressing. He's also going to make sure that the program at this school doesn't exceed what the Department of Education has allowed, so he's the one you should speak to if you have any concerns about what is going on here. Now can Ms--" he paused for a second before changing his mind "let's bring up someone new."He scanned the hall again, looking for a volunteer as every student did their best to hide. Raven squirmed as low as she could go in her chair without sliding off, trying to take advantage of the cover provided by the student in front of her."The young lady with the bow sitting in the back row, can you please come up?" He'd spotted her anyway.Raven felt instantly nervous as every pair of eyes turned to look at her. She glanced across the back row hoping that someone else had the same taste in fashion, but found no luck. She took her time shuffling out of her seat, trying to give the Headmaster every chance to change his mind. As she reached the bottom of stairs she noticed she'd started to perspire and had to take a breath before she could carry on. Mr O'Brien watched her as she passed up the stairs, eyes trailing her as surely as everyone in the audience behind her was also doing."No need to be shy, just stand here," the Headmaster indicated the centre of the stage. The stage lights were dim enough for Raven to see the audience but she still felt like she was the brightest object in the world as she moved into position."You're Ms Thompson, correct?" he asked as she reached the centre, facing her on an angle, half to her and half to the audience.She managed a nervous nod in response. He was more than a head taller than her and she had to look up to look into his eyes. His face seemed kind, with eyes a pale blue that was almost grey, but Raven still felt her legs wobbling nervously as he spoke again."Alright, Ms Thompson, would you like to introduce yourself to the audience?"She turned to the audience and managed to squeak through her name and age but didn't really know where to go from there and looked back to the Headmaster for guidance."That's fine, Ms Thompson, now how are you finding the chastity belt?"She hesitated, wondering if he knew, how he knew, before she swallowed the panic and went for broke, doubling down on the lie."It feels awkward and heavier than I'd expected" she answered, guessing at what he was expecting to hear. She even threw in a small hip wiggle in to try and prove the awkwardness she really felt, though for a different reason."That's no good" he responded looking worried, "would you mind lifting up your skirt?"There was a sudden intake of breath from the entire audience, had he really just asked that?Raven stared at him but didn't move, he'd called her bluff somehow and now she had nowhere to go. She turned to the man behind the clipboard in the hope of deliverance, though he didn't seem concerned about the Headmaster's request."Umm," she finally got out, suddenly feeling more flustered then even that day in the school bathroom."Ms Thompson please lift up your skirt, I need to check you're wearing it correctly. You might be hurting yourself by wearing it backwards or something."His tone was friendly and concerned, but that did nothing to calm Raven's rising panic. Repentance! her mind screamed at her as she remembered her mother's advice that it was always better to apologise and beg forgiveness than get caught red handed. Though, she thought, her mother was unlikely to have had this situation in mind. "I'm sorry, Headmaster," she began as quickly as possible, hoping that using his title would help her. "I didn't put it on, it felt humiliating and I just couldn't wear it. I left it in the tub." She felt a lot smaller as she said the words, it even felt like the stage light was getting brighter.His smile disappeared into to a look of disappointment as he stared straight into her eyes, maybe even into her soul."Stand up straight, Ms Thompson, and face the audience."She was too panicked to notice he hadn't said please, as she straightened her back and turned to look directly out at the audience. She saw Cassie in the front row, eyes fixed on her and looking worried. In the back of Raven's mind, she wanted to run, to jump off the stage and hide; but she couldn't bring herself to move. She felt her eyes began to moisten as she dreaded what would happen."Were my instructions unclear, Ms Thomson?" he asked from behind her, she could only hear his voice and it made her shiver."No, Headmaster""So, you just chose to ignore them?"She thought about mentioning Cassie, their whole discussion in the showers but that would have only gotten them both in trouble and betrayed her friend. She had to accept whatever was coming alone, and just get through the punishment."I'm sorry, Headmaster.""That's not what I asked" the voice moved to her right, but she didn't dare turn back to look. "I gave you instructions and you didn't follow them, do you understand how serious not following instructions can be?""I'm sorry, Headmaster, It just--" she began to answer. She felt sick in her stomach, getting into trouble always made her feel terrible."You're not some hyperactive five-year-old or troubled fifteen-year-old, Ms Thompson. You're an eighteen-year-old woman, halfway to nineteen. You're an adult. Do you think it's appropriate for an adult to just disregard instructions because they think they won't get caught?""No, Headmaster."There was a sudden bang, as a pair of hands behind her were clapped together and she jumped."Ms Thompson, I want to be very clear about your situation right now. You've been invited to my school because I believed you were a student who could learn from her mistakes, would work hard, and leave here with an education. Being here is not a punishment for your past actions, and I have no desire to make it so; but the first thing you've done here, is disobey my instructions and lie to me in front of the entire female student body." He paused to catch his breath, and Raven felt a tear run down her cheek. Her family had almost kicked her out of the house after she'd been expelled from her last school, only a letter from the Department of Education offering her a second chance at a new school had spared her."Did I make a mistake inviting you to this school, Ms Thompson?" The voice was calm but stern and Raven felt unbelievably small."No Headmaster, I'm so sorry. I'll never do it again." She shivered as she spoke, fear gripping her body, trying to get the maximum amount of apology into the fewest possible words."The bus is still outside, Ms Thompson, If you're not willing to do what's asked of you then there's no reason for you to stay here.""I'm sorry, Headmaster, please let me stay.""If you stay here I'm going to punish you, Ms Thompson. I'm going to punish you on stage in front of the assembly and it's not going to be pleasant. Are you sure you want that? I want you to think carefully before answering."She paused before answering, but the choice was obvious. Her family wouldn't welcome her back after getting kicked out of this new school on the first day. Even if that wasn't bad enough, there wasn't exactly a great future for people who failed to complete their final exams. She shut her eyes and pushed the panic down, wiping away a second tear on her face. The decision was made and there was no going back. Take the punishment, do whatever he said, and try and get through it as best she could."I want to stay, Headmaster" she said in a quiet voice."As you wish, Ms Thompson. For what it's worth, I think you've made the right decision. Now stand still, follow all of my instructions and don't move unless I tell you."Raven nodded and stood as still as she could, waiting for his first instruction. She could hear him shift behind her, moving in close. She felt a small tug at the bottom of her skirt followed by another tug on the other side. Eyes locked on the audience she didn't dare look down to see what was happening. The sudden feeling of cold on her legs explained it all, he was lifting her skirt up. The automatic part of her brain wanted to swat away the hands, but she held back. She pictured her pale legs and even whiter panties being slowly revealed and felt a cold sweat as she tried to remember if the panties were tight enough to show her camel toe."Hold your skirt up and keep it up," his voice commanded her.She reached out, grabbing the bundle in her arms and briefly grazing one of his hands as they were withdrawn. Her legs felt cold and unstable, she looked out at the audience, all of whom were fixated on the sight of her exposed panties. At least they were clean and new, she reflected, the ones she'd left with Ms Smith were starting to tear, and that was the last thing she needed right now. She saw Cassie's eyes widen for a second and wondered...SMACK!The blow struck her bottom without warning. Raven squealed, more from surprise than pain, and she dropped the skirt. As the stinging began, she felt a wave of anger and began turning to attack the source of the pain. Before she could get far a hand gripped her shoulder, stopping her instantly."I gave you instructions, Ms Thompson, what do you think you're doing?" The voice was stern but not angry.The shock from the impact was receding, leaving the much more painful stinging radiating from her bottom. She took a few breaths to recover, with her shoulder pinned by the man's grip she couldn't turn to face him as she spoke."Sorry, Headmaster, I wasn't expecting that."The grip on the shoulder loosened, but the hand remained."Alright, Ms Thompson; that might have been a bit much to expect from you without a proper warning. I'll go a bit slower for you this time. Move back into position and we'll start again.""Thank you, Headmaster," she said. The words felt bad as soon as she said them, she wanted to end the punishment quickly, not encourage him to continue. She felt the hand leave her shoulder and waited to feel the skirt being lifted again."I said resume your position, Ms Thompson."Raven frowned in confusion, this was her position wasn't it? She blushed when she finally worked it out. Having the Headmaster lift her skirt felt embarrassing, having to lift it herself was humiliating. Her face felt bright red and her body hot as she lifted the skirt.SMACK!The blow came quicker and landed on the opposite cheek this time, stinging worse than the first.She cried out a second time, skirt once again falling before she could stop it. The sting from the blow hurt but the humiliation, from being spanked in public and doing such a poor job of it made her feel far worse."Sorry, Headmaster, I couldn't help it, I'll get it right," she said quickly, getting in before he could admonish her again. She reached down to pull up her skirt straight away. Trying to show how seriously she was taking his instructions even if she was struggling.In the audience, Cassie watched closely as the girl she'd met willingly lifted her own skirt without being asked, face bright red as she stared out at the audience waiting for the punishment to continue. Behind her the Headmaster's face was calm and focused on his target as he relaxed his hand after the second blow. The man wasn't bad looking Cassie reflected, she'd often found herself more attracted to older men than the horny teenagers of her own age group. His face behind Raven's exposed panties wasn't exactly helping her to keep her thoughts pure."Very well, Ms Thompson, we'll try it again," the voice behind Raven said, further back this time. He sounded less stern, though that did nothing to stop the sinking feeling as she realised for the first time this might not be a quick punishment.The blow took it's time landing and she was forced to wait, skirt raised and legs wobbling in front of the audience. She tried her best to relax, telling herself the blow would be worse if she was tense but with each passing second the desire to turn around and see what was happening increased. Waiting only gave her time to think and nothing good came from reflecting on her current situation.SMACK!The blow finally landed and Raven grunted, but she managed to keep the skirt raised. The sting of the blow was overshadowed by a rush of pride and for a brief second a smile flashed across her face, she almost turned looking for praise.SMACK!Another blow followed without warning and she yelped in surprise but managed to stay still. She began to relax; if she could handle that she could get through the rest. That thought was shattered as the Headmaster suddenly appeared at her side, staring into the side of her face and making her flinch."I think we're getting the hang of this, Ms Thompson," he began, sounding somewhat pleased, "let's move on to the proper punishment.""WHAT?" She twisted her head to face him, keeping her body still and skirt raised as she moved."I'm right next to you, Miss Thompson, no need to shout." He kept his voice even as he spoke, but Raven could hear the warning. "Now that you've gotten a handle on following my instructions, we'll move on to the punishment."Raven's face dropped into a look of horror as he spoke. If that wasn't the punishment what the hell was coming next? The Headmaster disappeared behind her again and Raven was left feeling completely alone."Could you please take a few steps backwards, Ms Thompson; I'll stop you when you've gone far enough. You can let the skirt go when you finish." The Headmaster had gone, leaving only his voice and Raven shuddered at the sudden disconnect.Keeping her skirt held high she stepped backwards until the hand of the headmaster gently caught the small of her back. She allowed the skirt to fall, suddenly appreciating how much the skirt now meant to her.She stood motionless, waiting for another blow that had to be coming. A sudden tug on her waist began the next stage of punishment. She instinctively moved her head, twisting to see what was happening."Eyes forward, Ms Thompson," the voice warned. She quickly complied, frightened at the sudden command, and kept her head level and her eyes fixed on the back of the hall.The tug on her waist became two hands and she felt them moving around her waist. Slowly the motion became clearer as her skirt was unzipped. She shut her eyes tightly, trying desperately to shut out the sensation of the skirt falling around her ankles."Pass me the skirt and your tie," the voice said, feeling unbelievably close behind her.She took a second before reaching down and pulling the skirt from around her ankles, taking awkward steps with her naked legs to get clear before holding it out behind her, working hard to keep looking forward.The skirt was taken from her without a word and she began working on removing her tie with little success. Hands appeared in her peripheral vision, moving towards her neck and for a second she thought they were going to strangle her, but they merely loosened the tie before lifting it over her head. She felt her legs wobbling again as she stood more exposed than ever, hoping this was all a nightmare she'd wake up from.A hand gently gripped the back of her neck, just enough that her head was fixed facing forwards. "I want you to bend over now and rest your hands on your knees" the hand's owner said.Raven felt the hand on her neck slowly guide her down, preventing her from reversing course. She bent down, hands gripping her knees as she felt her bottom stick out horribly. She was facing down towards the stage floor, but as the hand was removed from her neck she snuck a quick look towards her crotch. Her movement or the position she'd taken had tightened the panties, and she could see the faint outline of her vagina peeking through the material. The blood slowly moving to her drooping head was aided by a massive blush.The legs of the Headmaster appeared on her right and he knelt next to her. His hand slowly appeared under her, coming to a stop on her chin and making contact. She realised he was directing her head and followed his hand upwards."Look at the audience, Ms Thompson," his voice commanded.Her neck stretched as she looked out at the rows of faces, all of them absolutely fixed on hers. The Headmaster's hand stayed on her chin, keeping her focus on the audience even as some of them tried to look away."I gave you a choice, Ms Thompson. You could get back on the bus and leave, or accept your punishment and stay. Have you changed your mind?""No, Headmaster." The reminder stung, she'd put got herself into this situation and had been made a willing participant."Do you think you've made a good impression today?""No, Headmaster.""I agree, Ms Thompson, so let's start making amends."Raven shuddered as she wondered how amends worked at a school where you were stripped and spanked on stage."Nothing too complicated for now, Ms Thompson, when you're smacked, I want you to apologise to everyone. Think you can manage that?"Raven stared out at the audience as she mentally worked through her task, trying to find Cassie again in the rows of faces. "Yes, Headmaster," she answered, and the hand was withdrawn from her chin, allowing her head to drop. She saw his legs disappear behind her again, and she gulped as she pictured him taking up position behind her.SMACK!Raven struggled to hold her position after the blow, vision dropping towards her legs as she shifted to maintain balance. Her eyes watered from the stinging and she tried to blink away the moisture before any tears escaped. As she slowly regained her composure she became aware of the presence of the Headmaster's hand. Where in previous blows the hand had been withdrawn after impact, this time it rested, before slowly sliding upwards. It came to a stop at the highest point of her protruding bottom. The motion sent a tingle through her legs and she fought off a shiver.Cassie studied the figure bent over on stage and saw her stiffen. There was no way to tell what had had such an impact--a poor choice of words--on the girl, but something had. She saw the Headmaster's hand resting on Raven's rear and felt a twinge beneath her skirt. She bit her lip to try and take her mind off the feeling."Hurry up, Ms Thompson, neither of us want this punishment to go on forever." The Headmaster gave her bottom a tiny smack to focus her attention before withdrawing the hand.Raven took a deep breath, both for the words and for the blow she expected to follow."I'm sorry everyone," she said, though not particularly loudly.SMACK!She tottered but managed to maintain her balance. The hand once again slid up the curve of her backside, moving slightly inwards as it travelled, before coming to rest on top again. Raven shivered this time as the tingle spread across her body."Make sure you look at the audience this time, Ms Thompson, and make sure you speak loudly enough that everyone can hear." The Headmaster kept his hand on her as he spoke.The touch felt warm and incredibly intimate, and Raven wanted desperately to shake it off. She took another breath before craning her head upwards to face the audience."I'm sorry everybody." She managed to be louder, but the truth was she was still holding back. She could almost feel the disappointment in the Headmaster's hand as it was withdrawn.SMACK!Raven let out an involuntary yelp as she flinched from the blow. She'd tensed at the wrong time and now the sting echoed through her body. Her legs shook from the blow and she winced from the pain, while her body stiffened and loosened in waves before she could regain control.The hand seemed aware of her discomfort and the stroke was softer as it brushed along her bottom, keeping contact as her backside wiggled forward and backwards, and following the crack between cheeks to the top of her bottom. She felt the same tingle again, though her body was too busy to react."I'm sorry everyone!" she shouted, the pain taking precedence over embarrassment.The hand seemed satisfied with the effort, giving her a friendly pat before beginning a slow and steady rub, back and forth across the top of her bottom. As the pain died down, Raven found she'd been unconsciously pushing her bottom back towards the hand, encouraging the rubbing to continue."Very good, Ms Thompson, that's the enthusiasm I hope you bring to the rest of your work at this school.""Thank you, Headmaster," Raven blushed, unsure what enthusiasm he was complimenting."Alright everybody, do you accept Ms Thompson's apology?"Raven stiffened, before looking pleadingly at the audience. Unfortunately, most were too transfixed, or terrified, to speak. There was a whisper, a few students quietly answering, but no overwhelming support. Raven felt a wave of dread as the hand was removed from her bottom.SMACK!"I'm sorry everyone!" Raven shouted again, a tear was rolling down her face but she maintained eye contact with the audience, silently pleading. The hand resumed rubbing her bottom, but Raven did her best to ignore it, hoping for an end to her torment."Alright everyone, do you accept her apology now?" The voice was slightly sterner this time. The encouragement seemed to work as the audience clearly, though still somewhat quietly, answered.Raven felt the tension leave her body, if the hand hadn't been on her she'd probably have stood without instruction. The voice returned, shattering Raven's feeling of relief."Have you made any friends yet, Ms Thompson?"Raven looked at Cassie and saw the look of worry on her face. She could tell where this was going and wanted desperately to leave Cassie out of this, but there was no way she could bring herself to lie in her current position."Yes Headmaster" she responded softly."Then I think it's probably a good idea to apologise to your friend directly, Ms Thompson." The hand was removed as he spoke and Raven felt her stomach drop.The look on Cassie's face changed from worry to mortified, as she realised what was about to happen. Raven did her best to maintain eye contact, despite Cassie's attempts to turn away.SMACK!"I'm sorry, Cassie." Raven felt no animosity towards her despite knowing they'd both forgone the chastity belt. Cassie's look of embarrassment left her feeling thoroughly ashamed. Raven allowed her eyes to drop back to the stage floor, no longer able to keep straining to face the audience."Do you accept Ms Thompson's apology, Cassie?"Raven tensed as Cassie took her time responding, quietly pleading for her to speak before another blow fell."Yes," came the answer, and Raven felt relieved once more."Are you feeling embarrassed, Ms Thompson?" The voice was alone. No blow or fondle followed and Raven found herself feeling suddenly isolated."Yes, Headmaster.""More embarrassed than you felt thinking about wearing the chastity belt?""Absolutely, Headmaster," she put as much enthusiasm into the words as possible."Very good, Ms Thompson, you're beginning to understand the consequences of not following my instructions." The voice paused. Raven felt the hand gently land on her bottom again, and she gave a small wiggle in acknowledgement before she realised what she was doing. "You can stand up now, Ms Thompson."Raven held still for a moment, before slowly standing up. She'd forgotten her appearance to the rest of the audience and made no effort to cover her exposed panties. She stood still, allowing the blood to clear from her head as she waited to be dismissed. The Headmaster appeared again and she put on her bravest smile in the hope that the punishment had finished; but his focus was elsewhere."Mr O'Brien," he called out to the old man, still standing at the side of the stage. "You're happy with everything that's happened so far?"Raven watched as the man gave a simple nod and then realised what the Headmaster had said, happened so far..."Ms Thompson, do you remember why I said you were being punished?" The Headmaster turned as he spoke, his pale eyes once again locking onto her own."Because I didn't follow your instructions," she began, then realised there had been a second reason. She struggled to remember but the Headmaster's eyes were locked on hers, stifling all speech."I also said you lied to me, Ms Thompson."Raven opened her mouth, but didn't know whether to agree with him, or to apologise again."So we're going to continue your punishment, Ms Thompson. I'd like you to start by turning your back to the audience."Raven's feet felt like lead but she slowly followed his instructions. The back of the stage was darker then she'd remembered, it dawned on her that someone must have turned the general stage lights down, leaving the spotlight focused on her."Stop there and assume the same position as before, Ms Thompson."Raven groaned as she realised what was happening. She closed her eyes and bent over at the waist, sticking out her bottom for the entire audience. The hands of the Headmaster suddenly landed on her hips and she jumped. They moved down, hooking themselves on the waistband of her panties. The overwhelming urge to force the hands away came and went as the hands slowly pulled her panties down."SIR!" she squealed, trying to stop his movement, but only succeeding in wiggling her bottom for the audience. The panties were slowly peeled off her crotch and Raven found her heart hammering as she felt the sudden exposure on her pussy. She shut her eyes as tightly as possible, closing her legs in the vain attempt to conceal her nakedness to the audience. The panties were just above her knees before they stopped, and Raven desperately hoped the Headmaster had changed his mind."Alright, Ms Thompson, I want you to spread your legs until the panties are tight.""Please, Headmaster," she pleaded."Now, and if you drop them then you'll be in for a far worse punishment"Raven quickly began spreading her legs, feeling every millimetre of exposure as her pussy was exposed to the audience. Her legs kept moving outwards and it seemed like the panties would never become tight. Finally she felt the tension increase and the hands holding them up were removed, leaving the panties suspended above her knees. She shuddered at the mental image, before realising the panties had slipped a precious few centimetres and she flinched into a slightly wider stance.The Headmaster's hand landed on her bottom with a gentle thwack sound. With the panties removed the audience could see the red patches on both cheeks from her punishment so far."Now, Ms Thompson, I'm beginning to see why you're so quick to follow my instructions."She felt his hand move down her bottom, before gently brushing the lips of her pussy, the sudden shock eliciting a squeal in response."You seem to be developing a bit of moisture, Ms Thompson, If I'd known you enjoyed being spanked I'd have used a different means of punishment.""No, sir!" she squealed again, moving her legs closer before feeling the panties begin to shift again."Be very careful, Ms Thompson, you're already in trouble for lying to me." The voice was less stern and that somehow made Raven even more nervous. "I'm going to resume the punishment, Ms Thompson, and this time I want you to apologise to me."SMACK!Robbed of all protection, the hand now fell on bare skin and Raven yelped at the blow. She took a few short breaths as she worked through the stinging, focused on keeping the panties off the floor.SMACK!Raven yelped again, this time in surprise. The Headmaster hadn't given her a chance to speak before striking again."I'm sorry, sir!" she squealed as quickly as she could manage."Very good, Ms Thompson." His hand moved along her bottom, giving her pussy another gentle stroke before disappearing.SMACK!"I'm sorry, sir""Again!"SMACK!"I'm sorry for lying to you. sir!" she almost cried, as she spoke. His hand stroked her pussy again and she let out a small sob, the conflicting sensations were becoming too much. The hand stopped, moving back to its resting position on top of her bottom. Raven felt exhausted and she struggled to catch her breath, as she waited for whatever came next. The hand waited, giving her a chance to recover while keeping her very much aware of its presence. She felt a droplet run down her thigh and wondered how badly she must be sweating before she remembered the Headmaster's words and shuddered."Ready to continue, Ms Thompson?" The Headmaster's voice was a welcome distraction from that train of thought and Raven let out a weary sigh."Yes, Headmaster."The hand was withdrawn and once again Raven found herself trying to relax her body, though not too much she remembered, just before the panties could slip any lower.SMACK!"I'm sorry, Headmaster."His hand moved straight to her pussy, gently rubbing up and down against her lips. She felt the tingle along her pussy spread through her body, sending her into a full body shiver that almost sent her toppling. The hand was quickly withdrawn to its resting position, stabilising her as she twitched."Very good, Ms Thompson, do you think I might've been right when I said you were enjoying this?"She hesitated, unsure how to answer his question. The warmth in her pussy was joined by another drop running down her thigh and she winced, her body seemed convinced he was right. Before she could speak the Headmaster continued, saving her from admitting anything."That's alright, you don't have to say it. How're you feeling?"After being asked if she was getting off on being spanked, Raven wasn't ready for the follow up, but as she opened her mouth to answer the easier question she realised she wasn't sure what how she felt, either. Her bottom was stinging and her head felt like lead, but her body felt hot and her crotch twitched eagerly for his hand to return."I'm okay, Headmaster" she eventually settled, not really answering his question and not really telling the truth, either."Good to hear, now can you tell me again why you were punished?"Raven thought for a second, choosing her words as carefully as her increasingly hot and twitchy body would allow. "Because I disobeyed your instructions and lied to you, Headmaster.""Correct, Ms Thompson. You can let your panties fall, but keep your legs open."Raven was relieved at the words, though the rational part of her brain was wondering how the hell those instructions brought relief. She shuffled her legs together and felt the panties fall around her ankles. The change in stance made her realise how much her legs had stiffened from holding them splayed out.The Headmaster gave her some time to recover before he continued speaking "I think you'll agree that was not your typical school punishment.""Absolutely, Headmaster," there was no way she was going to argue that.His hand slid down her bottom, beginning a gentle massage of her pussy and triggering a small moan."Are you going to follow my instructions from now on?""Yes, Headmaster.""Are you going to lie to me again?""No, Headmaster."His hand gave her clit a gentle squeeze and she let out a yelp. She could feel the moisture on the lips of her pussy shifting as she twitched, the warmth radiating through her body seemed to jump up a notch."If I invited your friend Cassie on stage, and asked her to lift up her skirt, would she be wearing a chastity belt?"The massaging had resumed and Raven's eyes were closed as she fought off the tingle in her crotch that grew with every stroke of the Headmaster's hand. Her breathing was rapid and she grit her teeth as her legs began a gradual shake. So much of her focus was on his hand she lacked the mental space to process the question and she ignored him.SMACK!The hand was withdrawn and the blow fell before Raven could process what was happening. She let out a squeal as the pain flew through her, triggering a wave of convulsions as her overstimulated body shifted from enjoyment to pain and back again faster than she could control it. She began to stand up but the Headmaster's hand was back on her neck keeping her head, and by extension the rest of her, pinned in position."I'll ask again. If I invited your friend Cassie on stage would I find her not wearing her chastity belt?"Raven's eyes had rolled to the back of her head and her teeth were gritted so tightly they seemed like they might break. But ever so slowly, she regained control, relaxing slowly and opening her eyes. Unfortunately, all she could see was the stage floor and not some means of escape. She felt the hand lifted from her neck slowly and realised what was coming. The bravery or foolishness she'd shown earlier when she'd tried to call his bluff was gone and she groaned internally before coming clean."No, Headmaster; we both decided not to wear them.""Thank you for your honesty. I hope next time you won't need to be punished before you tell the truth."Raven was about to answer when his hand returned to her crotch, starting to massage her clit directly and stopping the words in her throat.Raven's mind started floating again as the tingle in her crotch returned. She felt her legs stiffen without her input and her body felt like it was baking. Her eyes were closed as she felt the Headmaster's second hand grip the back of her neck again, locking her in place. Something clicked in the back of her mind and she was suddenly aware of a limit approaching. With each gentle circle of the Headmaster's hand on her clit that limit seemed to be getting closer and she tried desperately to stop it. Her legs began to close but his hand kept its position. She tensed her body, trying to fight off the feeling but that just made it worse.Then the hand stopped.In an instant, her mind screamed, where she'd been desperate to fight the rising feeling she felt her body instantly cry out for more. Her body pushed back, trying to bring his hand back into motion but it remained still. She started shivering as she opened her eyes, trying to work out what had stopped him when she was so close."Are you enjoying yourself?" was all he asked.Where before she'd have been horrified at the question, now she couldn't care less."Yes, Headmaster." Her voice was surprisingly ragged, and she realised how hard she was breathing."Do you think it's fair if I let you go any further? All the other students are going to have to wait for the first exam in two weeks for a chance to take their belt off. Why should you get special treatment because you misbehaved?""Because I...." Her body desperately wanted her to answer and twitched aggressively, overpowering the rational part of her brain that screamed at her to be embarrassed."I noticed you're wearing a bow. Given it's not part of the school uniform, it must be rather special for you to wear on your first day at a new school. Am I right?""Yes, Headmaster, I've had it since I was a little girl.""I'll let you make a choice then, you can put the chastity belt on right now, go and sit back down, and nothing else will happen. If you want to continue, then you'll have to promise me that you'll study so hard for your first exam that you'll get an A grade. But to make sure you don't go back on your word, I'll take your bow now and keep it safe as collateral."Raven hesitated even as her body tried desperately to hump his hand. She loved the bow--it was who she was. Even if she was desperate, how could she give up her bow without knowing she'd get it back."Will the exam be hard?" she finally managed to ask."Yes, but it'll be fair. I know you may feel differently, but I am a reasonable man. I've punished you because you disobeyed instructions, I've made you an offer because I can tell that you're a student who has potential.""Please, sir" she whispered quietly, after an eternity of soul searching."Pardon?"Raven shut her eyes, "Please continue, sir" she answered, loudly enough that the audience would hear as she knew he wanted. The hand on her neck moved to her hair, gently opening the clip on the bow and sliding it from her hair. She shuddered as she felt it disappear and fought back a tear at what she'd just agreed to.The hand in her crotch started moving again, rubbing her clit less gently and much faster now. She gasped at the sensation and felt herself instantly back at that place of overwhelming stimulation. Her entire body shivered as she felt her limit appear again, but she didn't care. The hand changed to just a finger, less of him touching her, but somehow stimulating her all the more. It slid around her crotch, around her clit and up and down her lips, drawing moisture as it moved.The finger pushed along the lips of her pussy, sliding over the moist surface and Raven felt her eyes begin to roll back. The finger pushed harder, increasing and she let out a moan loud enough for the entire audience to hear. The sounds of her breathing began to fade away as her world went black, then without warning, the finger pushed past the lips and entered her pussy."Fuck!" Raven cried out, suddenly snapping back to reality when she couldn't ignore the twinge in her pussy. She jolted away from the hand, her body unable to handle the intensity of the sensation but before she could get far, the Headmaster's other hand was back on her neck, pinning her again. As pleasurable as she found the sensation, the jolt back to reality also brought back another realisation, all her wiggling was front and centre and even spotlighted for the audience.The finger wasn't going particularly deep, the Headmaster was only up to the second knuckle, but all Raven felt was the overwhelming sensation of pleasure in her pussy that seemed to go all the way to her brain. It began sliding, pulling out and pushing in. With each movement it twisted and twirled, leaving no part of her pussy unstimulated. Raven was gasping for air as she felt her legs begin to shake. She let out a moan that turned into a squeal as the finger went deeper than before. All Raven could do, was hold herself upright as her body felt like it was on fire.Her brain screamed at her, telling her to resist, trying to stop everything before she was pushed too far in front of an audience, but before she knew it she reached her limit and climaxed. She let out a long squeal that filled the hall as she shook, her body jerked trying desperately to stop the pleasure even as it was overwhelmed by it. Her pussy clenched around the finger, quivering as it tried to keep the digit inside her. A splash of liquid escaped, splattering her legs and staining the panties around her ankles.She shook and shivered, unable to stop herself. Every time she thought she was under control, the smallest movement of her body would set her off again. She was gasping for air, held up more by the hand on her neck and the finger in her pussy, than any strength she had left in her legs.Very slowly, she regained her composure, her body feeling cold and tired from the all the movement. The Headmaster removed his hand, nearly setting off another wave of tremors as he did so. Her breathing slowed and she began to remember the world around her. What had she done? in front of all those people! She snapped her legs closed again as the embarrassment returned.There was an exhale from the audience, and Raven froze. Turning her head to the side she tried to look up at the Headmaster, but he was facing the audience. She couldn't turn around enough to see the audience and for the briefest moment, she considered opening her legs to look back, before the sheer embarrassment of her situation made her think better."You can stand up now." The Headmaster finally spoke, giving her bottom one more pat to make sure she was listening.She stood slowly, stretching her body and feeling like her legs were made of jelly. A single drop of moisture ran down the inside of her thigh and she winced, though the sensation sent a tingle down her spine that threatened to turn into another full body convulsion. She stood facing the rear of the stage, not daring to risk acting without instructions after all she'd been through. As she waited she could feel the stiffness in her body dissolve, only to be replaced with the gentle throbbing of her bruised bottom. It was probably bright red she thought, and probably spotlighted on stage for all the girls to see."How are you feeling now?" The Headmaster had appeared beside her, resting a hand on her shoulder. It felt warmer than she'd expected, a pleasant warmth she thought, until she realised it was probably the warmth from her pussy that she was feeling."I'm good, Headmaster" she answered, not willing to say anything else."I'm glad to hear it, now remember our deal when you leave the hall." He paused, looking at her and thinking. "Why don't you walk though that door when you're ready and Ms Smith will arrange for a fresh uniform for you." He was gesturing to a doorway at the back of the stage, hidden from the audience's view behind the curtains.Raven took a tentative step, the panties were still wrapped around her ankle and she wondered if she was supposed to pick them up. She turned to face the Headmaster, looking for guidance, he saw her glance and simply nodded for her to continue. A gentle flick of her foot released the panties and she relaxed more than she had in months.Cassie was silent in the audience, carefully watching as Raven walked off stage. Her face showed only the slightest hint of a scowl but internally she was fuming. She'd been wrong twice today and that rarely happened. The first time was when she'd tipped off Ms Smith about Raven's lack of belt. The goal was to draw attention away from herself, but Ms Smith had simply noted the fact and then asked Cassie about her belt. Cassie didn't feel too badly about that, she'd guessed it might happen and had apologised when questioned and quickly put on the belt.What really bothered her, was that she'd overestimated her influence on Raven. She'd done her best to befriend the shy girl, from the moment she'd seen her freaking out about accidentally wiggling for the boys by the bus. They'd shared their hostility to chastity belts and Cassie had encouraged her to avoid wearing it to build trust. There was no way she could have predicted Raven would sell her out for a quick hand job from the Headmaster.Still, it could have been worse she reflected. The belt was uncomfortable but she hadn't been spanked like the half-naked girl on stage for not wearing it. Cassie looked to her left and saw the rows of horny boys twisting in their seats to try and catch a glimpse of the face of the girl on stage, but the Headmaster was carefully blocking their view. Cassie smiled, Raven would hate finding out that the boys had quietly entered the room during her display, and that would suit Cassie just fine. <|endoftext|> "I had hoped our guest would arrive by now, but we'll keep things moving," he said, with a small clap of his hands. "Ms Margrie can you please open the box and take out the topmost item."All eyes were locked on the stage as Heather examined the box like she'd just been told it was a bomb, trying to hold it carefully at the maximum possible distance. She eventually found the latch and lifted the lid slowly away from her, blocking the audience's view. Raven heard the faint metallic clink of two pieces of metal colliding as Heather pulled something out.It was a shiny belt of some kind, though as Heather extracted it from the box, a new section attached to the belt appeared. Heather realised what it was and her mouth opened, Mr Clark saw the recognition and gestured for her to explain what it was."It's--" Heather tried, but couldn't bring herself to say anything further. Mr Clark gave her a few seconds to try to bring herself together, but the thought was still too much for her."What Ms Margrie is holding is known as a chastity belt" Mr Clark finally said, before holding out his hand for Heather to hand it over, which she eagerly did. "And it's going to be the first of many tools and techniques we'll be trialling at this school." He was showing it off, locking and unlocking the sections together. "Now these are a top-of-the-line design, so you'll get about a week of wear out of them before they need to be changed, and they'll have no impact on your use of the bathroom. They even have padding built in so you'll quickly forget you're wearing them. We really spared no expense on these items, so treat them well."There was whispering from the audience and Raven turned to look at Cassie, who was staring fixedly at the belt. Mr Clark had to raise his hands and wait for the noise to die down."I know you'll have some questions," he said, checking his watch again, "but our guest still hasn't arrived, so we'll give Ms Margrie a break and let her go. I was hoping to use her to provide a demonstration of the belt and some of the other tools, but we'll have to wait. Can you all please give Ms Margrie a round of applause for her assistance today while she returns to her seat."If ever a girl had been delivered by a higher power, they would've had the same look of relief as Heather Margrie. Mr Clark took the box from her, carefully putting the belt inside before closing the lid. He then put a hand on her shoulder and walked her gently to the stairs. He then ducked behind the curtains as Heather took her seat and the quiet applause stopped. When Mr Clark returned, he was carrying a plastic tub."Alright everyone, Ms Smith will take you all to the showers where you can freshen up from your trip. Each of you will be provided with one of these tubs with a uniform in your size, please make sure you get the tub with your name on it. These uniforms are not going to be mandatory for your entire stay here, but they will be a requirement during learning hours. Please put your normal clothes back in the tub and they'll be returned to you this evening along with your luggage on the bus" He took a breath and looked at the back of the hall to confirm Ms Smith had returned. "Each tub contains a chastity belt that's been assigned to you. If you've managed to wear underwear before, you can figure out how to put these on, but Ms Smith will be there to answer any questions. Put them on," he paused to emphasize the instruction, "and make sure you secure them by closing the lock and handing the key to Ms Smith. There's only one key per belt so if you lose it, you'll find yourself having an unpleasant stay here." He paused, thinking of what else he needed to say before allowing them to leave."Thank you all for paying attention so far, I'll go over the program when you return and I'll answer as many questions as I can. The first few days will be mostly orientation, so please don't stress if you miss a chance to ask a question." He took a breath before stretching out his hands to let Ms Smith take over.The girls left the assembly hall and followed Ms Smith down a corridor. None of them willing to speak about what they'd just seen. They passed through another pair of doors into large gymnasium, before entering a changing room where a small table had been set up. Ms Smith assumed her position behind the table before indicating the girls should form a single line in front.Raven took advantage of the bathroom, ending up at the back of the line and forced to wait as Ms Smith methodically went through the tubs, checking each girl's name on a list and handing them a corresponding tub. Raven's mind kept going back to the sight of the belt in Mr Clark's hands as he pointed to the various features. When she reached the front of the queue Ms Smith gave her a warm smile and asked for her name."Raven Thompson" she answered, nervousness obvious in her voice.Ms Smith went down the length of the list with her finger and put a check mark against her name, before reaching over and grabbing a tub."Showers are behind you, there's a small changing section with a towel and toiletries in each cubicle so you can freshen up. Once you're clean you can change into the uniform and put everything else back in the tub, just make sure you keep the key to the belt separate and hand it back to me." Ms Smith passed over the tub, which Raven timidly accepted.She walked down the tiled floor of the changeroom, passing rows of open cubicles. With a realisation that nearly made her drop the tub, she saw that while each cubicle had solid walls to the floor, none of them had any doors.She walked carefully between the cubicles, trying carefully to see if any were free while also not looking at the semi-nude to outright naked figures who occupied almost all of them. She finally reached a row of empty cubicles near the rear and decided after a second to take the cubicle on the left. Apart from the notable missing door, the design was a typical camping ground shower cubicle, with a forward changing and rear shower section. She put the tub on the small bench, next to a few bottles of soap and hair products, with a hook above supporting a clean white towel.With a deep sigh she opened the lid of the tub. Lying immediately on top was the chastity belt, resting in a velvet lined case with a clear cover to show off the belt within. She looked around embarrassed, even though no one was around to see her before deciding to have the shower before dealing with the tub.She took the towel from the hook and folded it neatly on the bench as close to the shower as possible, before moving the bottles of soap and shampoo into the floor of the shower area. She looked across and saw Cassie entering the cubicle opposite her.Raven watched as Cassie opened her own tub and saw the belt lying on top, blushing a little as she opened the case and took it out for closer inspection. Cassie held it up to the light, inspecting it from every angle before lowering it in front of her crotch, visualising how it would fit. She finally looked at Raven and raised an eyebrow, before tossing it back into the tub.Raven started to strip down, removing each item of clothing carefully and folding them as she went. As she began to lay her clothes on the bench she caught sight of the belt at the top of the open tub and shuddered, before closing the tub and putting all her clothes on top to bury it.In the other cubicle, Raven saw Cassie was stripping down, though her motions seemed far smoother, as she tossed her discarded items of clothing aside. Raven looked at the curvy body opposite and compared it to her own petite frame with embarrassment. She could fight the feeling down when comparing herself to women like Ms Smith, thinking that in some vague future she would have a body like that, but here was a student with a gorgeous body, large breasts and wide hips who didn't have to wait.Raven looked away before Cassie could catch her gawking, and started the shower, the water was hot and Raven enjoyed the sting as she washed the stiffness out of her body. The soap was a generic brand, but it smelled nice and Raven scrubbed away at the accumulated grime from two days of travel. She finished washing at the same time as Cassie and the two walked towards each other for a second as they exited the shower, and for a second, Raven thought she saw a twitch of a smile from Cassie, but it was probably just in her head.Raven dried herself off, careful not to knock her clothes off the tub, before hanging the towel back on the hook. She looked at the tub, staring in the hope it might change contents if she just willed it enough. Unfortunately, it hadn't and she found herself staring at the belt again as she moved her clothes and opened the tub. She went to reach for it, but stopped and brought her arm back. She wasn't afraid of it, at least she didn't think fear was the right word, was she embarrassed by it? She finally settled on humiliated. Humiliated at the idea of being forced to wear a metal belt over a private part of her body. Humiliated that a stranger would hold the literal key to parts of her.She finally worked up the courage to pick up the case, and after a brief struggle with the clasp, take out the belt. The first thing she noticed was the weight. It was surprisingly heavy, maybe even a full kilogram of metal. She turned it around, inspecting it. There were two loops of metal, both with spongy padding wherever they were designed to touch skin. The waist band was only a few centimetres wide and felt cool to the touch, though keeping against a body would heat it up quickly. On one side of the waistband was a lock, not much bigger than the belt, but with curved edges to avoid digging into flesh. It had an engraved serial number, to identify lock and key. A central strap joined the belt in two places, wider than the waistband and designed to go between her legs and firmly against the body. There were perforations in two places, though which way they went on wasn't immediately clear.Cassie spent longer drying off thanks to her long hair and turned to see her neighbour staring at the belt and looking overwhelmed."Psst," she whispered, trying to get Raven's attention but without success. "Raven," she whispered again, clicking her fingers and getting Raven's attention. Cassie nodded at the belt in Raven's hand before shaking her head, but Raven's didn't understand the message."They can't make you wear it" Cassie whispered, though as she checked down the aisle Ms Smith was still at the front of the room and couldn't possibly hear her."What?" Raven whispered back, instinctively mirroring Cassie's secrecy."No way they can make us wear a chastity belt, they can't force us to wear it if we don't want to."Raven considered herself a polite and well-behaved girl who never broke the rules except, she thought, for the day that had brought her here. She would look back later and wonder why she made the choice she did, eventually deciding on a mixture of a desire to appear cool in front of a much cooler girl and her own desire to avoid that feeling of humiliation every time she shifted her hips."You?" she asked back.Cassie shook her head and tossed the belt back in the tub, before thinking it through. She carefully emptied the uniform from the tub, placing a layer of her own clothes in, before grabbing the belt. She held it in her hands for a few seconds before realising the key was still in the packet. Removing the key she tossed the belt and the packet deep into the tub before burying it under the rest of her clothes, keeping the key in her hand.Raven worked out what she was doing, carefully removing the rest of the school uniform and hiding the chastity belt amongst her own clothing. She kept the key separate as she added the packet to the tub before closing it up. She shared a conspiratorial smile with Cassie before turning to change into the new uniform.The uniform consisted of a blouse, skirt, tie and white underwear. Raven got the underwear on and was surprised at how comfortably they fit her. She remembered the forms she'd spent hours filling out before coming to the school and tried to recall if they'd asked about underwear sizes. The blouse was white with short sleeves and buttons running up the entire length of the middle that caused Raven no end of frustration as she struggled to get them all buttoned up.The skirt was a patterned black and white affair that stopped exactly halfway down her thighs, slightly higher than she would have preferred, but not as bad as the one she'd worn during her high school years that had threatened to expose her with every gust of wind, or careless bend of the waist. The tie was the same plaid pattern as the skirt and was a first for Raven, who had to get Cassie to show her how to tie it around her neck.Looking back at the bench she saw that the shoes, with socks bundled inside had fallen behind the tub and she quickly added black socks and shoes to her new ensemble. She thought briefly about the bow she wore in her hair and decided she'd wear it until she was told otherwise, it was a tiny bit of colour her mother had given her that always brought joy.She and Cassie checked each other out, evaluating the look they couldn't see on themselves since the cubicles lacked mirrors. It wasn't a bad look Raven had to admit, she'd often felt school uniforms made the wearer look juvenile, but she didn't feel bad about this. The shirt managed to look professional, though slightly enhancing the curves on her opposite and showing off her own lack of them. The skirt had two thin pockets and her blouse had a single pocket on the left breast and she silently thanked the designer for incorporating a long-desired feature.They walked together back to Ms Smith, arms carrying the tubs with the belts concealed inside. Having entered at the back of the line they'd finished changing later than the rest of the girls and walked past empty cubicles. As they approached Ms Smith, Cassie slowed to allow Raven to go first, though Raven would have preferred to stay behind her. She worried the guilt was written on her face as she placed the tub on the table."All finished?" Ms Smith looked her over to confirm the uniform was in place. She paused briefly at the bow but didn't say anything and returned to scanning, getting embarrassingly low.Raven squeezed her legs together as the gaze reached her thighs, trying to conceal what was already hidden by the skirt, before responding with a small, "All done."Ms Smith checked the name on the tub and ticked it off her checklist for a second time. She held out her hand and Raven took a second to realise what she was after before she placed the key in Ms Smith's hand."Everything go okay getting the belt on?""All good," Raven said just a little too quickly before adding "heavier than I expected."Ms Smith nodded thoughtfully, "You'll get used to it."Not while it's in the tub Raven thought, as she was allowed to walk out of the changing room empty handed. A small feeling of guilt nestling in the back of her mind as she thought about the lie she'd just gotten away with. She saw the rest of her new classmates in matching outfits sitting against the wall in small groups. Deciding that she'd rather wait for Cassie she took a few steps to the side and stood waiting for her friend to exit. Cassie and Ms Smith exited the changeroom after a minute or so and the entire group was summoned to stand up and return to the assembly hall.They all returned to the assembly hall, again limiting their seating to just the right half. Raven sat at the back this time, she'd lost track of Cassie during the shuffle and was now stuck sitting next to a tall blonde girl.The stage had a new occupant, an elderly man with a receding hairline and a thin grey beard. He was standing off to the side and holding a clipboard that was evidently more interesting than the roomful of students. Mr Clark, Headmaster, Raven reminded herself walked back on the stage as Ms Smith walked down the stairs and left the hall. He took a brief look around the hall, scanning each row before resuming his presentation."Welcome back ladies, you're all looking very nice in your uniforms. I'd like you to meet our esteemed guest, Mr O'Brien." The old man looked up from his clipboard and nodded but otherwise remained motionless."Mr O'Brien is going to be an evaluator for the school, assessing how well your studies are progressing. He's also going to make sure that the program at this school doesn't exceed what the Department of Education has allowed, so he's the one you should speak to if you have any concerns about what is going on here. Now can Ms--" he paused for a second before changing his mind "let's bring up someone new."He scanned the hall again, looking for a volunteer as every student did their best to hide. Raven squirmed as low as she could go in her chair without sliding off, trying to take advantage of the cover provided by the student in front of her."The young lady with the bow sitting in the back row, can you please come up?" He'd spotted her anyway.Raven felt instantly nervous as every pair of eyes turned to look at her. She glanced across the back row hoping that someone else had the same taste in fashion, but found no luck. She took her time shuffling out of her seat, trying to give the Headmaster every chance to change his mind. As she reached the bottom of stairs she noticed she'd started to perspire and had to take a breath before she could carry on. Mr O'Brien watched her as she passed up the stairs, eyes trailing her as surely as everyone in the audience behind her was also doing."No need to be shy, just stand here," the Headmaster indicated the centre of the stage. The stage lights were dim enough for Raven to see the audience but she still felt like she was the brightest object in the world as she moved into position."You're Ms Thompson, correct?" he asked as she reached the centre, facing her on an angle, half to her and half to the audience.She managed a nervous nod in response. He was more than a head taller than her and she had to look up to look into his eyes. His face seemed kind, with eyes a pale blue that was almost grey, but Raven still felt her legs wobbling nervously as he spoke again."Alright, Ms Thompson, would you like to introduce yourself to the audience?"She turned to the audience and managed to squeak through her name and age but didn't really know where to go from there and looked back to the Headmaster for guidance."That's fine, Ms Thompson, now how are you finding the chastity belt?"She hesitated, wondering if he knew, how he knew, before she swallowed the panic and went for broke, doubling down on the lie."It feels awkward and heavier than I'd expected" she answered, guessing at what he was expecting to hear. She even threw in a small hip wiggle in to try and prove the awkwardness she really felt, though for a different reason."That's no good" he responded looking worried, "would you mind lifting up your skirt?"There was a sudden intake of breath from the entire audience, had he really just asked that?Raven stared at him but didn't move, he'd called her bluff somehow and now she had nowhere to go. She turned to the man behind the clipboard in the hope of deliverance, though he didn't seem concerned about the Headmaster's request."Umm," she finally got out, suddenly feeling more flustered then even that day in the school bathroom."Ms Thompson please lift up your skirt, I need to check you're wearing it correctly. You might be hurting yourself by wearing it backwards or something."His tone was friendly and concerned, but that did nothing to calm Raven's rising panic. Repentance! her mind screamed at her as she remembered her mother's advice that it was always better to apologise and beg forgiveness than get caught red handed. Though, she thought, her mother was unlikely to have had this situation in mind.
 "I'm sorry, Headmaster," she began as quickly as possible, hoping that using his title would help her. "I didn't put it on, it felt humiliating and I just couldn't wear it. I left it in the tub." She felt a lot smaller as she said the words, it even felt like the stage light was getting brighter.His smile disappeared into to a look of disappointment as he stared straight into her eyes, maybe even into her soul."Stand up straight, Ms Thompson, and face the audience."She was too panicked to notice he hadn't said please, as she straightened her back and turned to look directly out at the audience. She saw Cassie in the front row, eyes fixed on her and looking worried. In the back of Raven's mind, she wanted to run, to jump off the stage and hide; but she couldn't bring herself to move. She felt her eyes began to moisten as she dreaded what would happen."Were my instructions unclear, Ms Thomson?" he asked from behind her, she could only hear his voice and it made her shiver."No, Headmaster""So, you just chose to ignore them?"She thought about mentioning Cassie, their whole discussion in the showers but that would have only gotten them both in trouble and betrayed her friend. She had to accept whatever was coming alone, and just get through the punishment."I'm sorry, Headmaster.""That's not what I asked" the voice moved to her right, but she didn't dare turn back to look. "I gave you instructions and you didn't follow them, do you understand how serious not following instructions can be?""I'm sorry, Headmaster, It just--" she began to answer. She felt sick in her stomach, getting into trouble always made her feel terrible."You're not some hyperactive five-year-old or troubled fifteen-year-old, Ms Thompson. You're an eighteen-year-old woman, halfway to nineteen. You're an adult. Do you think it's appropriate for an adult to just disregard instructions because they think they won't get caught?""No, Headmaster."There was a sudden bang, as a pair of hands behind her were clapped together and she jumped."Ms Thompson, I want to be very clear about your situation right now. You've been invited to my school because I believed you were a student who could learn from her mistakes, would work hard, and leave here with an education. Being here is not a punishment for your past actions, and I have no desire to make it so; but the first thing you've done here, is disobey my instructions and lie to me in front of the entire female student body." He paused to catch his breath, and Raven felt a tear run down her cheek. Her family had almost kicked her out of the house after she'd been expelled from her last school, only a letter from the Department of Education offering her a second chance at a new school had spared her."Did I make a mistake inviting you to this school, Ms Thompson?" The voice was calm but stern and Raven felt unbelievably small."No Headmaster, I'm so sorry. I'll never do it again." She shivered as she spoke, fear gripping her body, trying to get the maximum amount of apology into the fewest possible words."The bus is still outside, Ms Thompson, If you're not willing to do what's asked of you then there's no reason for you to stay here.""I'm sorry, Headmaster, please let me stay.""If you stay here I'm going to punish you, Ms Thompson. I'm going to punish you on stage in front of the assembly and it's not going to be pleasant. Are you sure you want that? I want you to think carefully before answering."She paused before answering, but the choice was obvious. Her family wouldn't welcome her back after getting kicked out of this new school on the first day. Even if that wasn't bad enough, there wasn't exactly a great future for people who failed to complete their final exams. She shut her eyes and pushed the panic down, wiping away a second tear on her face. The decision was made and there was no going back. Take the punishment, do whatever he said, and try and get through it as best she could."I want to stay, Headmaster" she said in a quiet voice."As you wish, Ms Thompson. For what it's worth, I think you've made the right decision. Now stand still, follow all of my instructions and don't move unless I tell you."Raven nodded and stood as still as she could, waiting for his first instruction. She could hear him shift behind her, moving in close. She felt a small tug at the bottom of her skirt followed by another tug on the other side. Eyes locked on the audience she didn't dare look down to see what was happening. The sudden feeling of cold on her legs explained it all, he was lifting her skirt up. The automatic part of her brain wanted to swat away the hands, but she held back. She pictured her pale legs and even whiter panties being slowly revealed and felt a cold sweat as she tried to remember if the panties were tight enough to show her camel toe."Hold your skirt up and keep it up," his voice commanded her.She reached out, grabbing the bundle in her arms and briefly grazing one of his hands as they were withdrawn. Her legs felt cold and unstable, she looked out at the audience, all of whom were fixated on the sight of her exposed panties. At least they were clean and new, she reflected, the ones she'd left with Ms Smith were starting to tear, and that was the last thing she needed right now. She saw Cassie's eyes widen for a second and wondered...SMACK!The blow struck her bottom without warning. Raven squealed, more from surprise than pain, and she dropped the skirt. As the stinging began, she felt a wave of anger and began turning to attack the source of the pain. Before she could get far a hand gripped her shoulder, stopping her instantly."I gave you instructions, Ms Thompson, what do you think you're doing?" The voice was stern but not angry.The shock from the impact was receding, leaving the much more painful stinging radiating from her bottom. She took a few breaths to recover, with her shoulder pinned by the man's grip she couldn't turn to face him as she spoke."Sorry, Headmaster, I wasn't expecting that."The grip on the shoulder loosened, but the hand remained."Alright, Ms Thompson; that might have been a bit much to expect from you without a proper warning. I'll go a bit slower for you this time. Move back into position and we'll start again.""Thank you, Headmaster," she said. The words felt bad as soon as she said them, she wanted to end the punishment quickly, not encourage him to continue. She felt the hand leave her shoulder and waited to feel the skirt being lifted again."I said resume your position, Ms Thompson."Raven frowned in confusion, this was her position wasn't it? She blushed when she finally worked it out. Having the Headmaster lift her skirt felt embarrassing, having to lift it herself was humiliating. Her face felt bright red and her body hot as she lifted the skirt.SMACK!The blow came quicker and landed on the opposite cheek this time, stinging worse than the first.She cried out a second time, skirt once again falling before she could stop it. The sting from the blow hurt but the humiliation, from being spanked in public and doing such a poor job of it made her feel far worse."Sorry, Headmaster, I couldn't help it, I'll get it right," she said quickly, getting in before he could admonish her again. She reached down to pull up her skirt straight away. Trying to show how seriously she was taking his instructions even if she was struggling.In the audience, Cassie watched closely as the girl she'd met willingly lifted her own skirt without being asked, face bright red as she stared out at the audience waiting for the punishment to continue. Behind her the Headmaster's face was calm and focused on his target as he relaxed his hand after the second blow. The man wasn't bad looking Cassie reflected, she'd often found herself more attracted to older men than the horny teenagers of her own age group. His face behind Raven's exposed panties wasn't exactly helping her to keep her thoughts pure."Very well, Ms Thompson, we'll try it again," the voice behind Raven said, further back this time. He sounded less stern, though that did nothing to stop the sinking feeling as she realised for the first time this might not be a quick punishment.The blow took it's time landing and she was forced to wait, skirt raised and legs wobbling in front of the audience. She tried her best to relax, telling herself the blow would be worse if she was tense but with each passing second the desire to turn around and see what was happening increased. Waiting only gave her time to think and nothing good came from reflecting on her current situation.SMACK!The blow finally landed and Raven grunted, but she managed to keep the skirt raised. The sting of the blow was overshadowed by a rush of pride and for a brief second a smile flashed across her face, she almost turned looking for praise.SMACK!Another blow followed without warning and she yelped in surprise but managed to stay still. She began to relax; if she could handle that she could get through the rest. That thought was shattered as the Headmaster suddenly appeared at her side, staring into the side of her face and making her flinch."I think we're getting the hang of this, Ms Thompson," he began, sounding somewhat pleased, "let's move on to the proper punishment.""WHAT?" She twisted her head to face him, keeping her body still and skirt raised as she moved."I'm right next to you, Miss Thompson, no need to shout." He kept his voice even as he spoke, but Raven could hear the warning. "Now that you've gotten a handle on following my instructions, we'll move on to the punishment."Raven's face dropped into a look of horror as he spoke. If that wasn't the punishment what the hell was coming next? The Headmaster disappeared behind her again and Raven was left feeling completely alone."Could you please take a few steps backwards, Ms Thompson; I'll stop you when you've gone far enough. You can let the skirt go when you finish." The Headmaster had gone, leaving only his voice and Raven shuddered at the sudden disconnect.Keeping her skirt held high she stepped backwards until the hand of the headmaster gently caught the small of her back. She allowed the skirt to fall, suddenly appreciating how much the skirt now meant to her.She stood motionless, waiting for another blow that had to be coming. A sudden tug on her waist began the next stage of punishment. She instinctively moved her head, twisting to see what was happening."Eyes forward, Ms Thompson," the voice warned. She quickly complied, frightened at the sudden command, and kept her head level and her eyes fixed on the back of the hall.The tug on her waist became two hands and she felt them moving around her waist. Slowly the motion became clearer as her skirt was unzipped. She shut her eyes tightly, trying desperately to shut out the sensation of the skirt falling around her ankles."Pass me the skirt and your tie," the voice said, feeling unbelievably close behind her.She took a second before reaching down and pulling the skirt from around her ankles, taking awkward steps with her naked legs to get clear before holding it out behind her, working hard to keep looking forward.The skirt was taken from her without a word and she began working on removing her tie with little success. Hands appeared in her peripheral vision, moving towards her neck and for a second she thought they were going to strangle her, but they merely loosened the tie before lifting it over her head. She felt her legs wobbling again as she stood more exposed than ever, hoping this was all a nightmare she'd wake up from.A hand gently gripped the back of her neck, just enough that her head was fixed facing forwards. "I want you to bend over now and rest your hands on your knees" the hand's owner said.Raven felt the hand on her neck slowly guide her down, preventing her from reversing course. She bent down, hands gripping her knees as she felt her bottom stick out horribly. She was facing down towards the stage floor, but as the hand was removed from her neck she snuck a quick look towards her crotch. Her movement or the position she'd taken had tightened the panties, and she could see the faint outline of her vagina peeking through the material. The blood slowly moving to her drooping head was aided by a massive blush.The legs of the Headmaster appeared on her right and he knelt next to her. His hand slowly appeared under her, coming to a stop on her chin and making contact. She realised he was directing her head and followed his hand upwards."Look at the audience, Ms Thompson," his voice commanded.Her neck stretched as she looked out at the rows of faces, all of them absolutely fixed on hers. The Headmaster's hand stayed on her chin, keeping her focus on the audience even as some of them tried to look away."I gave you a choice, Ms Thompson. You could get back on the bus and leave, or accept your punishment and stay. Have you changed your mind?""No, Headmaster." The reminder stung, she'd put got herself into this situation and had been made a willing participant."Do you think you've made a good impression today?""No, Headmaster.""I agree, Ms Thompson, so let's start making amends."Raven shuddered as she wondered how amends worked at a school where you were stripped and spanked on stage."Nothing too complicated for now, Ms Thompson, when you're smacked, I want you to apologise to everyone. Think you can manage that?"Raven stared out at the audience as she mentally worked through her task, trying to find Cassie again in the rows of faces. "Yes, Headmaster," she answered, and the hand was withdrawn from her chin, allowing her head to drop. She saw his legs disappear behind her again, and she gulped as she pictured him taking up position behind her.SMACK!Raven struggled to hold her position after the blow, vision dropping towards her legs as she shifted to maintain balance. Her eyes watered from the stinging and she tried to blink away the moisture before any tears escaped. As she slowly regained her composure she became aware of the presence of the Headmaster's hand. Where in previous blows the hand had been withdrawn after impact, this time it rested, before slowly sliding upwards. It came to a stop at the highest point of her protruding bottom. The motion sent a tingle through her legs and she fought off a shiver.Cassie studied the figure bent over on stage and saw her stiffen. There was no way to tell what had had such an impact--a poor choice of words--on the girl, but something had. She saw the Headmaster's hand resting on Raven's rear and felt a twinge beneath her skirt. She bit her lip to try and take her mind off the feeling."Hurry up, Ms Thompson, neither of us want this punishment to go on forever." The Headmaster gave her bottom a tiny smack to focus her attention before withdrawing the hand.Raven took a deep breath, both for the words and for the blow she expected to follow."I'm sorry everyone," she said, though not particularly loudly.SMACK!She tottered but managed to maintain her balance. The hand once again slid up the curve of her backside, moving slightly inwards as it travelled, before coming to rest on top again. Raven shivered this time as the tingle spread across her body."Make sure you look at the audience this time, Ms Thompson, and make sure you speak loudly enough that everyone can hear." The Headmaster kept his hand on her as he spoke.The touch felt warm and incredibly intimate, and Raven wanted desperately to shake it off. She took another breath before craning her head upwards to face the audience."I'm sorry everybody." She managed to be louder, but the truth was she was still holding back. She could almost feel the disappointment in the Headmaster's hand as it was withdrawn.SMACK!Raven let out an involuntary yelp as she flinched from the blow. She'd tensed at the wrong time and now the sting echoed through her body. Her legs shook from the blow and she winced from the pain, while her body stiffened and loosened in waves before she could regain control.The hand seemed aware of her discomfort and the stroke was softer as it brushed along her bottom, keeping contact as her backside wiggled forward and backwards, and following the crack between cheeks to the top of her bottom. She felt the same tingle again, though her body was too busy to react."I'm sorry everyone!" she shouted, the pain taking precedence over embarrassment.The hand seemed satisfied with the effort, giving her a friendly pat before beginning a slow and steady rub, back and forth across the top of her bottom. As the pain died down, Raven found she'd been unconsciously pushing her bottom back towards the hand, encouraging the rubbing to continue."Very good, Ms Thompson, that's the enthusiasm I hope you bring to the rest of your work at this school.""Thank you, Headmaster," Raven blushed, unsure what enthusiasm he was complimenting."Alright everybody, do you accept Ms Thompson's apology?"Raven stiffened, before looking pleadingly at the audience. Unfortunately, most were too transfixed, or terrified, to speak. There was a whisper, a few students quietly answering, but no overwhelming support. Raven felt a wave of dread as the hand was removed from her bottom.SMACK!"I'm sorry everyone!" Raven shouted again, a tear was rolling down her face but she maintained eye contact with the audience, silently pleading. The hand resumed rubbing her bottom, but Raven did her best to ignore it, hoping for an end to her torment."Alright everyone, do you accept her apology now?" The voice was slightly sterner this time. The encouragement seemed to work as the audience clearly, though still somewhat quietly, answered.Raven felt the tension leave her body, if the hand hadn't been on her she'd probably have stood without instruction. The voice returned, shattering Raven's feeling of relief."Have you made any friends yet, Ms Thompson?"Raven looked at Cassie and saw the look of worry on her face. She could tell where this was going and wanted desperately to leave Cassie out of this, but there was no way she could bring herself to lie in her current position."Yes Headmaster" she responded softly."Then I think it's probably a good idea to apologise to your friend directly, Ms Thompson." The hand was removed as he spoke and Raven felt her stomach drop.The look on Cassie's face changed from worry to mortified, as she realised what was about to happen. Raven did her best to maintain eye contact, despite Cassie's attempts to turn away.SMACK!"I'm sorry, Cassie." Raven felt no animosity towards her despite knowing they'd both forgone the chastity belt. Cassie's look of embarrassment left her feeling thoroughly ashamed. Raven allowed her eyes to drop back to the stage floor, no longer able to keep straining to face the audience."Do you accept Ms Thompson's apology, Cassie?"Raven tensed as Cassie took her time responding, quietly pleading for her to speak before another blow fell."Yes," came the answer, and Raven felt relieved once more."Are you feeling embarrassed, Ms Thompson?" The voice was alone. No blow or fondle followed and Raven found herself feeling suddenly isolated."Yes, Headmaster.""More embarrassed than you felt thinking about wearing the chastity belt?""Absolutely, Headmaster," she put as much enthusiasm into the words as possible."Very good, Ms Thompson, you're beginning to understand the consequences of not following my instructions." The voice paused. Raven felt the hand gently land on her bottom again, and she gave a small wiggle in acknowledgement before she realised what she was doing.
 "You can stand up now, Ms Thompson."Raven held still for a moment, before slowly standing up. She'd forgotten her appearance to the rest of the audience and made no effort to cover her exposed panties. She stood still, allowing the blood to clear from her head as she waited to be dismissed. The Headmaster appeared again and she put on her bravest smile in the hope that the punishment had finished; but his focus was elsewhere."Mr O'Brien," he called out to the old man, still standing at the side of the stage. "You're happy with everything that's happened so far?"Raven watched as the man gave a simple nod and then realised what the Headmaster had said, happened so far..."Ms Thompson, do you remember why I said you were being punished?" The Headmaster turned as he spoke, his pale eyes once again locking onto her own."Because I didn't follow your instructions," she began, then realised there had been a second reason. She struggled to remember but the Headmaster's eyes were locked on hers, stifling all speech."I also said you lied to me, Ms Thompson."Raven opened her mouth, but didn't know whether to agree with him, or to apologise again."So we're going to continue your punishment, Ms Thompson. I'd like you to start by turning your back to the audience."Raven's feet felt like lead but she slowly followed his instructions. The back of the stage was darker then she'd remembered, it dawned on her that someone must have turned the general stage lights down, leaving the spotlight focused on her."Stop there and assume the same position as before, Ms Thompson."Raven groaned as she realised what was happening. She closed her eyes and bent over at the waist, sticking out her bottom for the entire audience. The hands of the Headmaster suddenly landed on her hips and she jumped. They moved down, hooking themselves on the waistband of her panties. The overwhelming urge to force the hands away came and went as the hands slowly pulled her panties down."SIR!" she squealed, trying to stop his movement, but only succeeding in wiggling her bottom for the audience. The panties were slowly peeled off her crotch and Raven found her heart hammering as she felt the sudden exposure on her pussy. She shut her eyes as tightly as possible, closing her legs in the vain attempt to conceal her nakedness to the audience. The panties were just above her knees before they stopped, and Raven desperately hoped the Headmaster had changed his mind."Alright, Ms Thompson, I want you to spread your legs until the panties are tight.""Please, Headmaster," she pleaded."Now, and if you drop them then you'll be in for a far worse punishment"Raven quickly began spreading her legs, feeling every millimetre of exposure as her pussy was exposed to the audience. Her legs kept moving outwards and it seemed like the panties would never become tight. Finally she felt the tension increase and the hands holding them up were removed, leaving the panties suspended above her knees. She shuddered at the mental image, before realising the panties had slipped a precious few centimetres and she flinched into a slightly wider stance.The Headmaster's hand landed on her bottom with a gentle thwack sound. With the panties removed the audience could see the red patches on both cheeks from her punishment so far."Now, Ms Thompson, I'm beginning to see why you're so quick to follow my instructions."She felt his hand move down her bottom, before gently brushing the lips of her pussy, the sudden shock eliciting a squeal in response."You seem to be developing a bit of moisture, Ms Thompson, If I'd known you enjoyed being spanked I'd have used a different means of punishment.""No, sir!" she squealed again, moving her legs closer before feeling the panties begin to shift again."Be very careful, Ms Thompson, you're already in trouble for lying to me." The voice was less stern and that somehow made Raven even more nervous. "I'm going to resume the punishment, Ms Thompson, and this time I want you to apologise to me."SMACK!Robbed of all protection, the hand now fell on bare skin and Raven yelped at the blow. She took a few short breaths as she worked through the stinging, focused on keeping the panties off the floor.SMACK!Raven yelped again, this time in surprise. The Headmaster hadn't given her a chance to speak before striking again."I'm sorry, sir!" she squealed as quickly as she could manage."Very good, Ms Thompson." His hand moved along her bottom, giving her pussy another gentle stroke before disappearing.SMACK!"I'm sorry, sir""Again!"SMACK!"I'm sorry for lying to you. sir!" she almost cried, as she spoke. His hand stroked her pussy again and she let out a small sob, the conflicting sensations were becoming too much. The hand stopped, moving back to its resting position on top of her bottom. Raven felt exhausted and she struggled to catch her breath, as she waited for whatever came next. The hand waited, giving her a chance to recover while keeping her very much aware of its presence. She felt a droplet run down her thigh and wondered how badly she must be sweating before she remembered the Headmaster's words and shuddered."Ready to continue, Ms Thompson?" The Headmaster's voice was a welcome distraction from that train of thought and Raven let out a weary sigh."Yes, Headmaster."The hand was withdrawn and once again Raven found herself trying to relax her body, though not too much she remembered, just before the panties could slip any lower.SMACK!"I'm sorry, Headmaster."His hand moved straight to her pussy, gently rubbing up and down against her lips. She felt the tingle along her pussy spread through her body, sending her into a full body shiver that almost sent her toppling. The hand was quickly withdrawn to its resting position, stabilising her as she twitched."Very good, Ms Thompson, do you think I might've been right when I said you were enjoying this?"She hesitated, unsure how to answer his question. The warmth in her pussy was joined by another drop running down her thigh and she winced, her body seemed convinced he was right. Before she could speak the Headmaster continued, saving her from admitting anything."That's alright, you don't have to say it. How're you feeling?"After being asked if she was getting off on being spanked, Raven wasn't ready for the follow up, but as she opened her mouth to answer the easier question she realised she wasn't sure what how she felt, either. Her bottom was stinging and her head felt like lead, but her body felt hot and her crotch twitched eagerly for his hand to return."I'm okay, Headmaster" she eventually settled, not really answering his question and not really telling the truth, either."Good to hear, now can you tell me again why you were punished?"Raven thought for a second, choosing her words as carefully as her increasingly hot and twitchy body would allow. "Because I disobeyed your instructions and lied to you, Headmaster.""Correct, Ms Thompson. You can let your panties fall, but keep your legs open."Raven was relieved at the words, though the rational part of her brain was wondering how the hell those instructions brought relief. She shuffled her legs together and felt the panties fall around her ankles. The change in stance made her realise how much her legs had stiffened from holding them splayed out.The Headmaster gave her some time to recover before he continued speaking "I think you'll agree that was not your typical school punishment.""Absolutely, Headmaster," there was no way she was going to argue that.His hand slid down her bottom, beginning a gentle massage of her pussy and triggering a small moan."Are you going to follow my instructions from now on?""Yes, Headmaster.""Are you going to lie to me again?""No, Headmaster."His hand gave her clit a gentle squeeze and she let out a yelp. She could feel the moisture on the lips of her pussy shifting as she twitched, the warmth radiating through her body seemed to jump up a notch."If I invited your friend Cassie on stage, and asked her to lift up her skirt, would she be wearing a chastity belt?"The massaging had resumed and Raven's eyes were closed as she fought off the tingle in her crotch that grew with every stroke of the Headmaster's hand. Her breathing was rapid and she grit her teeth as her legs began a gradual shake. So much of her focus was on his hand she lacked the mental space to process the question and she ignored him.SMACK!The hand was withdrawn and the blow fell before Raven could process what was happening. She let out a squeal as the pain flew through her, triggering a wave of convulsions as her overstimulated body shifted from enjoyment to pain and back again faster than she could control it. She began to stand up but the Headmaster's hand was back on her neck keeping her head, and by extension the rest of her, pinned in position."I'll ask again. If I invited your friend Cassie on stage would I find her not wearing her chastity belt?"Raven's eyes had rolled to the back of her head and her teeth were gritted so tightly they seemed like they might break. But ever so slowly, she regained control, relaxing slowly and opening her eyes. Unfortunately, all she could see was the stage floor and not some means of escape. She felt the hand lifted from her neck slowly and realised what was coming. The bravery or foolishness she'd shown earlier when she'd tried to call his bluff was gone and she groaned internally before coming clean."No, Headmaster; we both decided not to wear them.""Thank you for your honesty. I hope next time you won't need to be punished before you tell the truth."Raven was about to answer when his hand returned to her crotch, starting to massage her clit directly and stopping the words in her throat.Raven's mind started floating again as the tingle in her crotch returned. She felt her legs stiffen without her input and her body felt like it was baking. Her eyes were closed as she felt the Headmaster's second hand grip the back of her neck again, locking her in place. Something clicked in the back of her mind and she was suddenly aware of a limit approaching. With each gentle circle of the Headmaster's hand on her clit that limit seemed to be getting closer and she tried desperately to stop it. Her legs began to close but his hand kept its position. She tensed her body, trying to fight off the feeling but that just made it worse.Then the hand stopped.In an instant, her mind screamed, where she'd been desperate to fight the rising feeling she felt her body instantly cry out for more. Her body pushed back, trying to bring his hand back into motion but it remained still. She started shivering as she opened her eyes, trying to work out what had stopped him when she was so close."Are you enjoying yourself?" was all he asked.Where before she'd have been horrified at the question, now she couldn't care less."Yes, Headmaster." Her voice was surprisingly ragged, and she realised how hard she was breathing."Do you think it's fair if I let you go any further? All the other students are going to have to wait for the first exam in two weeks for a chance to take their belt off. Why should you get special treatment because you misbehaved?""Because I...." Her body desperately wanted her to answer and twitched aggressively, overpowering the rational part of her brain that screamed at her to be embarrassed."I noticed you're wearing a bow. Given it's not part of the school uniform, it must be rather special for you to wear on your first day at a new school. Am I right?""Yes, Headmaster, I've had it since I was a little girl.""I'll let you make a choice then, you can put the chastity belt on right now, go and sit back down, and nothing else will happen. If you want to continue, then you'll have to promise me that you'll study so hard for your first exam that you'll get an A grade. But to make sure you don't go back on your word, I'll take your bow now and keep it safe as collateral."Raven hesitated even as her body tried desperately to hump his hand. She loved the bow--it was who she was. Even if she was desperate, how could she give up her bow without knowing she'd get it back."Will the exam be hard?" she finally managed to ask."Yes, but it'll be fair. I know you may feel differently, but I am a reasonable man. I've punished you because you disobeyed instructions, I've made you an offer because I can tell that you're a student who has potential.""Please, sir" she whispered quietly, after an eternity of soul searching."Pardon?"Raven shut her eyes, "Please continue, sir" she answered, loudly enough that the audience would hear as she knew he wanted. The hand on her neck moved to her hair, gently opening the clip on the bow and sliding it from her hair. She shuddered as she felt it disappear and fought back a tear at what she'd just agreed to.The hand in her crotch started moving again, rubbing her clit less gently and much faster now. She gasped at the sensation and felt herself instantly back at that place of overwhelming stimulation. Her entire body shivered as she felt her limit appear again, but she didn't care. The hand changed to just a finger, less of him touching her, but somehow stimulating her all the more. It slid around her crotch, around her clit and up and down her lips, drawing moisture as it moved.The finger pushed along the lips of her pussy, sliding over the moist surface and Raven felt her eyes begin to roll back. The finger pushed harder, increasing and she let out a moan loud enough for the entire audience to hear. The sounds of her breathing began to fade away as her world went black, then without warning, the finger pushed past the lips and entered her pussy."Fuck!" Raven cried out, suddenly snapping back to reality when she couldn't ignore the twinge in her pussy. She jolted away from the hand, her body unable to handle the intensity of the sensation but before she could get far, the Headmaster's other hand was back on her neck, pinning her again. As pleasurable as she found the sensation, the jolt back to reality also brought back another realisation, all her wiggling was front and centre and even spotlighted for the audience.The finger wasn't going particularly deep, the Headmaster was only up to the second knuckle, but all Raven felt was the overwhelming sensation of pleasure in her pussy that seemed to go all the way to her brain. It began sliding, pulling out and pushing in. With each movement it twisted and twirled, leaving no part of her pussy unstimulated. Raven was gasping for air as she felt her legs begin to shake. She let out a moan that turned into a squeal as the finger went deeper than before. All Raven could do, was hold herself upright as her body felt like it was on fire.Her brain screamed at her, telling her to resist, trying to stop everything before she was pushed too far in front of an audience, but before she knew it she reached her limit and climaxed. She let out a long squeal that filled the hall as she shook, her body jerked trying desperately to stop the pleasure even as it was overwhelmed by it. Her pussy clenched around the finger, quivering as it tried to keep the digit inside her. A splash of liquid escaped, splattering her legs and staining the panties around her ankles.She shook and shivered, unable to stop herself. Every time she thought she was under control, the smallest movement of her body would set her off again. She was gasping for air, held up more by the hand on her neck and the finger in her pussy, than any strength she had left in her legs.Very slowly, she regained her composure, her body feeling cold and tired from the all the movement. The Headmaster removed his hand, nearly setting off another wave of tremors as he did so. Her breathing slowed and she began to remember the world around her. What had she done? in front of all those people! She snapped her legs closed again as the embarrassment returned.There was an exhale from the audience, and Raven froze. Turning her head to the side she tried to look up at the Headmaster, but he was facing the audience. She couldn't turn around enough to see the audience and for the briefest moment, she considered opening her legs to look back, before the sheer embarrassment of her situation made her think better."You can stand up now." The Headmaster finally spoke, giving her bottom one more pat to make sure she was listening.She stood slowly, stretching her body and feeling like her legs were made of jelly. A single drop of moisture ran down the inside of her thigh and she winced, though the sensation sent a tingle down her spine that threatened to turn into another full body convulsion. She stood facing the rear of the stage, not daring to risk acting without instructions after all she'd been through. As she waited she could feel the stiffness in her body dissolve, only to be replaced with the gentle throbbing of her bruised bottom. It was probably bright red she thought, and probably spotlighted on stage for all the girls to see."How are you feeling now?" The Headmaster had appeared beside her, resting a hand on her shoulder. It felt warmer than she'd expected, a pleasant warmth she thought, until she realised it was probably the warmth from her pussy that she was feeling."I'm good, Headmaster" she answered, not willing to say anything else."I'm glad to hear it, now remember our deal when you leave the hall." He paused, looking at her and thinking. "Why don't you walk though that door when you're ready and Ms Smith will arrange for a fresh uniform for you." He was gesturing to a doorway at the back of the stage, hidden from the audience's view behind the curtains.Raven took a tentative step, the panties were still wrapped around her ankle and she wondered if she was supposed to pick them up. She turned to face the Headmaster, looking for guidance, he saw her glance and simply nodded for her to continue. A gentle flick of her foot released the panties and she relaxed more than she had in months.Cassie was silent in the audience, carefully watching as Raven walked off stage. Her face showed only the slightest hint of a scowl but internally she was fuming. She'd been wrong twice today and that rarely happened. The first time was when she'd tipped off Ms Smith about Raven's lack of belt. The goal was to draw attention away from herself, but Ms Smith had simply noted the fact and then asked Cassie about her belt. Cassie didn't feel too badly about that, she'd guessed it might happen and had apologised when questioned and quickly put on the belt.What really bothered her, was that she'd overestimated her influence on Raven. She'd done her best to befriend the shy girl, from the moment she'd seen her freaking out about accidentally wiggling for the boys by the bus. They'd shared their hostility to chastity belts and Cassie had encouraged her to avoid wearing it to build trust. There was no way she could have predicted Raven would sell her out for a quick hand job from the Headmaster.Still, it could have been worse she reflected. The belt was uncomfortable but she hadn't been spanked like the half-naked girl on stage for not wearing it. Cassie looked to her left and saw the rows of horny boys twisting in their seats to try and catch a glimpse of the face of the girl on stage, but the Headmaster was carefully blocking their view. Cassie smiled, Raven would hate finding out that the boys had quietly entered the room during her display, and that would suit Cassie just fine.
