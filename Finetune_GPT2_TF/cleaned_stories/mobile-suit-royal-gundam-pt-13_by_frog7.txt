She looks around and sees her orange shades and quickly puts them on.A nurse comes in, "Hello. I'm Rita your nurse."Echo starts to get up."Hey easy!""I'm fine, I don't need medical attention, I need my mobile suit!""You're mobile suit is completely trashed. You're lucky to be alive.""You won't be if I don't get out of here!""As usual you have to act crazy!" A familiar voice says."Sir!" The nurse says nervously."It's alright, come back in a few minutes."As soon as the nurse left Echo snaps, "The fuck you doing here, Vice Chief!?""I was just checking up on you.""As I said before you're concern isn't needed!""Really, who do you think got you out of that wreckage and held on to your precious shades?"She was silent for a minute and then speaks, "You should have just left me there."He sighs, "Why?""Did we win?""According to the Chief we did.""You sound doubtful.""Of course I do because the truth is we got our asses kicked but a fuckin AI!""Of course we did. Now I'm going to take an HLV and...""No you will not!""Try and stop me!""Oh I will." He pulls out a gun. "We've already been through this. You said you needed my help so we're doing it my way, understand?!""The balls on you!""Do you understand?!"She relaxes herself in the bed. "So how long will I be here?""Just until they make sure everything is fine.""Sir, there's a Roddrick here to see you," the nurse announces."Send him in.""Hello Sir.""Good see you alright."He nods. "Have you seen Gal, I tried calling but nothing. I asked the nursing station and they don't have a record of her here. Is she still out?""Gal's dead," Agent Orange says grimly.Both men look at her. "Wha...wha...what?" Roddrick stammers."Yeah she didn't make it.""You saw her, where?!""She's dead! Her mobile suit exploded into nothingness!" She snaps.Roddrick just stood there and then he slowly turns around and leaves.The Vice Chief starts shedding tears and he looks at her and she instantly looks away."****The UltimateMeghan was shaking as she opens a bottom of juice."Lamb are you alright?" Captain Vance asks."Yeah I'm good.""Is Ensign Wheat back?""As far as I know the Gundam hasn't come back.""Sigh, great we have to go get her, Lieutenant Moses with me, the rest of you remain alert.""I'm coming too," Meghan declares."Fine."Five Alpha Shrikes set out."Do you think we can overcome them next time?" Ensign Lamb asks."We have to, Zoya is there waiting for us!" Captain Vance answers."Yes and I for one would like to see it with my own eyes, the eyes of a human not a machine," Lieutenant Moses adds.They maintain a steady pace, all was quiet but the Alpha Shrikes felt uneasy. "We're passing through what was the minefield," Captain Vance announces. As they continued on they start to see the remains of Mobile Dolls."Man it sure was a lot of them," Ensign Lamb observers."Everyone be on guard, there could be live ones pretending to be dead.""Roger!" They all say in unison and continue on."I count 100 destroyed," Ensign Lamb says."It's more than that, much more," Lieutenant Moses corrects."Wheat, Ensign Wheat can you hear me? Ensign Wheat are you there?""She might be already dead," the Alpha Shrike Marcel says."We'll go for another hour and then return to The Ultimate."They continue searching."Did the mines do all this?" The Alpha Shrike Luka asks."No we're way pass them.""So far none of these match the Gundam remains.""Then there's hope," Ensign Lamb says."She could have been blown completely into nothingness," Ensign Luka suggests.Suddenly they hear bashing. They head towards the sound armed and ready. A few minutes later they find the Royal Gundam beating a Mobile Doll with the heat hammer. She moves on."Ensign Wheat! Ensign Wheat!"She looks at them, "Oh hey Captain. I'll scout ahead in case they try to flank us.""Wheat why didn't answer when I called earlier?"She flies on."Wheat? Ensign Wheat I'm talking to you!""Oh hey Captain. I'll scout ahead in case they try to flank us.""What?!""Wheat the battle is over, we're heading home," Lieutenant Moses says."I'll scout ahead in case they try to flank us."Lieutenant Moses was stunned.Ensign Lamb gets in front of her. "Bernkastel we're pulling back.""I'll scout ahead in case they try to flank us.""Wheat enough!" Captain Vance yells."Oh hey Captain. I'll scout ahead in case they try to flank us.""Holy god she's lost it!" Ensign Marcel screams."Um Bernkastel, I think I saw enemies heading towards The Ultimate.""We have to get there!" Bernkastel speed to The Ultimate with others following."Holy shit did she do all of this by herself?" Ensign Luca asks.The Royal Gundam suddenly stops and turns around."Wheat what are doing?""Oh hey Captain. I'll scout ahead in case they try to flank us.""Bernkastel the enemy is at The Ultimate.""Oh right."They continue on until they reach The Ultimate. "Oh looks like the Mobile Dolls have fled," Ensign Lamb lies.Bernkastel breaths a sigh of relief."Alright let's land," Captain Vance orders."I'll scout ahead in case they try to flank us.""Negative, get some chow first.""Ok." Once they land Bernkastel yawns loudly. "Oh hey Captain. I'll scout ahead in case they try to flank us.""Wheat you're scaring us."She ignores her and heads back to the Royal Gundam."Wheat stop where you are!""Deus, Deus!" She suddenly stops. "Huh? When did I get back here? Oh hey Captain. Megan, Moses, Zepho, everyone.""Bernkastel are you alright?""Yeah, starving.""Wheat, go get yourself checked out.""I'm fine, just hungry.""You will get a psychiatric evaluation first!""Um ok, Ma'am."****Grail, EarthTwo days had passed, Echo was at the funeral repast drinking alcohol. She looks at the Vice Chief who was busy trying to console the Alfredo Family. Roddrick sits next to her. "Here have mine.""I'm not old enough.""Who gives a fuck?""What were her last moments?""She fought..." She gets up out of her seat."Why? Why did Gal have to die?!""Because she was a cowardly brat," she thought.****The Chief of State hands a drink to the Vice Chief. "With the other counsel members dead I'm going to need you now more than ever.""I understand."They leave the repast and head over to the Kits Estate. Once they arrive she makes the call to the Supreme Leader Dudael.Supreme Leader Dudael: "Hello Chief Kits, I trust things are well."Chief Kits: "Hardly, we've suffered a huge defeat, you must have as well."Supreme Leader Dudael: "I'll admit we have. So what exactly do you want?"Chief Kits: "Did you get the message from Deus about meeting him at his space factory?"Supreme Leader Dudael: "Yes I did and I do not plan to surrender."Chief Kits: "Good because my offer still stands."Supreme Leader Dudael: "Your offer? You mean to form an alliance?"Chief Kits: "I do, I'm regrouping my forces in preparations for an offensive against Deus. But it won't be enough but together we may stand a chance."Supreme Leader Dudael: "If I do agree to this alliance I expect negotiations to reopen."Chief Kits: "Yes, yes, whatever you want, I just want this to be over, there's been too much death. The preservation of the human race is paramount! Our war no longer matters. We can discuss it in full details on Luna."Supreme Leader Dudael: "Very well I await your arrival."Once the call of ends, the Chief sighs. "Vice Chief, you're in charge until I get back.""I should go instead.""No, we're trying to build up trust so I will go. If they truly want to return home they will not try anything stupid at least I hope they won't."****LunaOnce the call ends the Supreme Leader summons Bernkastel."I've come as ordered, Sir!""Wheat I heard about what occurred, are you ok?""Yes Sir I am fine, I'm not really sure what happened.""I think I know," he smiles. "It's like the first time you piloted the Royal Gundam and then the negotiation battle. Fighting is what drives you, it's what will bring out your Newtype abilities but you must control it.""Yes Sir I will.""You slew 1,000 Mobile Dolls and for that I'm promoting you to a Lieutenant Junior Grade.She nearly falls. "A Lieutenant Junior Grade?""Yes.""Thank you Sir, I will live up to your expectations!"His smile fades to a serious look, "Wheat, the Earth Republic Chief of State is coming here for a meeting, and I would like for you to attend that meeting.""Yes Sir." Glendarah is coming here?! Is she in desperate mode?"You're dismissed! And get some rest.""Yes Sir!" She salutes him and leaves.****May 1, 2099The Chief of State Glendarah Kits arrives with her personal guards and among them was General Babar and his children. The Supreme Leader, Lady Helga, Zam Überstein, and Lieutenant Junior Grade Bernkastel Wheat and the personal guard appear and greet them. "So we finally meet in person.""Indeed." She glances at Bernkastel who looks the other way."It's too bad that the former Chief of State is no longer with us.""Yes but she would be happy knowing that we're finally talking things out."They make their way to the main conference room. As they pass by the Zoya soldiers salute their Supreme Leader and Lady Helga. There were no curious eyes only alert eyes for the Supreme Leader withheld no secrets from them well that wasn't strictly true.Once they enter each take a seat and the Supreme Leader begins, "This is my head of intelligence Zam Überstein, he and newly promoted Lieutenant Junior Grade Wheat were on the space factory, I thought they might provide some further information on it."Lady Helga rolls her eyes when he said that, "Why of all people she's here?""Thank you but that won't be necessary for Vice Chief Alex Bonaparte and Agent Echo Orange are alive and well and provided much needed information.""Bitch," Lady Helga thought."I'll get straight to the point, the Earth Republic has suffered heavy casualties from the Mobile Dolls, as I said before I want this to be over. May I inquire how strong your fleet is?""We have seventy five ships remaining including my ship The Ultimate.""That's good, I propose a joint fleet as a start.""That all depends if you are ready to negotiate?""Yes, we can resume talks once Deus has been taken offline, how does that suit you?""We can negotiate now," Lady Helga interjects."Very well, whatever you want."Bernkastel couldn't believe what she was seeing, Chief Glendarah Kits was one of the prominent members of the anti Zoya faction but now she was beaten, bested and broken by Deus.As the negotiation went on, the Supreme Leader begins to feel uncomfortable but no one save Lady Helga notices.A few minutes later Chief Kits excuses herself to use the restroom. Once she left the Supreme Leader turns to Bernkastel. "Can this woman be trusted?" Both her, Lady Helga and Überstein were surprised that he would asked that. "You know this woman, can she be trusted?"All eyes fell on Bernkastel. "She seemed sad, the Mobile Dolls were something she clearly underestimated. With two defeats in a row I can only imagine the pressure she's under from the people. She's truly desperate so I say we can trust her. This is about the self preservation of humanity. She can't lead if there's no one alive to follow.""I'll trust your judgement."She notices a disappointed look on his face.Chief Kits returns and they resume negotiations.****Magnolia and several Shrikes were in the Luna main hanger watching the Teutonics being loaded in. "They truly are ugly," Meghan whispers."Yeah.""Do you think negotiations will fall in our favor?""We'll know soon enough, just remain alert.""I wonder how Bernkastel is doing.""What does that bitch have that the rest of us don't have? She's two minutes late, leaves her post to go on a killing spree thus worrying us and what does she get? A fuckin promotion! And she gets invited to this meeting! I should have stayed on the Ultimate!" Magnolia thought.They notice one of the Teutonic models have a black line across the white torso almost like a deep cut. It opens up and the pilot floats down to the floor. "Alright good one everyone." Once the hanger door was closed the pilot removes the helmet revealing a woman with raven black hair and a scar across her face."Man she is ugly," Meghan whispers to Commander Holly who nods. "Are all Earth Republic women like that? And look at that guy with the ugly face.""She doesn't look that bad," Moses murmurs to himself.She was joined by several others who went to an empty area to converse and eat. Some of them give the Alpha Shrikes the glare of a basilisk. Meghan shrinks back. "Meghan that's what they want. We have control over Luna, they are nothing.""That right," Second Lieutenant Selena murmurs, coming towards them. As far as she was concerned they were just a bunch of dirty animals and she like the rest of the had no intention of mixing with them regardless if the human race was on the verge of extinction and Bernkastel was no different from them and furthermore it irked her as well that Bernkastel was ahead of her yet again but at least she was a junior officer at last."Moses gets up and walks over to Earth Republicans. "Moses?" Abigail questions. They all watch as he approaches them. Commander Balrog gets up to confront the smaller man. "What do you want, Zoya?""I was curious about the Teutonic with the black line on the torso, it looks almost like a scar."Commander Barcelona stands up. "That came from an axe.""Did it now? Then will I be right to assume that you are in possession of a crossbow?"Her eyes widen in surprise. "You!""That's right, I am Lieutenant Moses, the one with the labrys that cut through your mobile suit. May I have the honor of your name?""Commander Barcelona!""Your skills are impressive. Since we're going to be comrades soon I look forward to fighting alongside you." He offers his hand which surprises both sides.She looks at his hand and gives him a weird look. "I'm not touching your disease hand!""Diseased?! How dare you!" Lieutenant Commander Abigail screams. The Zoya side gets ready to fight and Commander Balrog shoves Lieutenant Moses."Special Forces and staff, stand down!" General Babar barks. "We're guests here.""Guests? Well if that's true then they're uninvited guests!" Commander Barcelona yells."Yeah that's a laugh," Ensign Meghan says."Just wait until the Hospitaller is put into mass production!""Hospitaller? Wait that was the name of the mobile armor!" Captain Vance exclaims."Yes and I am its pilot!"Captain Vance grits her teeth. "You bastard! You killed Captain Brax! You killed the man I loved!" She pulls out her sidearm followed by the rest of Zoya and the Earth Republic members pulls out theirs. Commander Barcelona and Lieutenant Moses glare at each other."Enough!" The Supreme Leader's voice boomed in the Zoya minds while Chief Kits tells her side to stand down.There was a few minutes of silence and then the Chief of State speaks, "As of now the Earth Republic will be fighting alongside the Zoya Remnant." Both sides slowly put up their side arms. "I shall retire to my ship and leave tomorrow. I will also leave one Celestial ship behind since we're in an alliance now. I expect them to be treated well and any POWs you have be released immediately. And no mind reading unless I consent to it.""Yes of course."Captain Vance balls her hand into a fist and leaves. Commander Barcelona and Lieutenant Moses exchange one last look before going their separate ways.****Bernkastel was in her room staring at the ceiling, the negotiation was a success, the 1st Post Apocalyptic War was going to end once they defeated Deus but even though it's what she wanted since her Earth Republic days she was concerned about the Supreme Leader and Chief Kits. "Maybe Deus was too much for them both," she thought.She tosses and turns but couldn't sleep. No she didn't need sleep, she needed closure. She quickly gets up, puts on her normal suit and heads out. She quickly makes her way to the main hanger and board the Royal Gundam. She walks towards the catapult."Lieutenant, no orders were issued for you to go out," the communications officer radios."There's something I have to do, I'll be back soon.""Lieutenant?!"She turns off the radio and launches.She makes her way pass Luna towards the three Celestial ships. The one in the middle known as the Robert Kits was the largest and the Chief's personal ship. "This is Lieutenant Junior Grade Bernkastel Wheat, I would like to speak to the Chief of State, requesting permission to land. Repeat, this Lieutenant Junior Grade Bernkastel Wheat, I would like to speak to the Chief of State, requesting permission to land."She hovers around for a few minutes before her request was granted. Once she lands she is greeted with glares. "Perhaps this wasn't such a good idea," she thought. Two of the Chief's bodyguards arrive. "Come with us." She holds Haro and proceeds to follow them.She reaches the Chief's quarters and the Chief gives her an annoying look. "Leave us.""But Ma'am!""Relax the traitor won't do anything." Once the guards leave she speaks, "I was preparing for lunch but now I have to deal with you. Well speak up!""Adriana, what happened to her body?""You came all this way for that? Her remains were cremated.""I see.""Is that all? You may go!""That wasn't my only question."She sighs, "Looks like I'm going to have to order lunch for two?""Yes that would be nice."She rolls her eyes."Did you kill my grandpa?""Agent Orange who was Marius did it.""It's funny you should say that because I used to believe that but she denied it twice. In fact I called her a liar but then I remembered something. Back on the HLV Falcon she proclaimed killing the crew members with glee. All that time I've met her all she ever talked about was killing me, my grandpa, best friend, my ex and the late Chief of State so it was strange that she would deny doing it. Captain Juan was sent to kill me, at first I thought it was the late Doris Bonaparte but such a tactic is not something she would ever pull, she wanted peace just as I do.""What about the Vice Chief?""You think I spent that much time on the space factory and a full week getting back to Luna without questioning him? Despite the fact we ended on bad terms he would never do anything to jeopardize the Bonaparte name, he's just like his mother. So that's just leaves you. So did you or did you not kill my grandpa?""Captain Juan and his team did it.""They would have had no reason to unless someone ordered them to, so stop fucking around!""The mouth on you," she laughs. "Fine then, I admit it, Captain Juan pulled the trigger but I provided the gun.""Why Glendarah, why?!""That's Chief Kits to you! You're not on that level to use my first name and frankly you will never will be!""But why did you have my grandpa killed and why did you order Captain Juan to kill me!? Why?!"Chief Kits exits the table and turns away from her and unzips the back of her dress. "This is why." Bernkastel could a see a massive 08TH that had been branded on her back. "I knew of my parents but I never knew them. I was born in a fuckin concentration camp! My dad was murdered and mom died giving birth to me and before she could give me a name so what did they do? They named me after the fuckin concentration camp! 08th! They branded an infant!" "Are you Zoyanese?""Hell no and thank god I'm not. They just transferred me around and eventually I ended up in Zoya! I spent 18 years in a fuckin concentration camp! Everything I did, everything I've done wasn't never for myself! It was to make sure that future generations would never have to see the accursed Zoya flag fly in the Earth Republic sky! To make sure they never experience the pain and suffering that I've experience!"She starts to cry. "I once had friends just like you!" She pulls out her phone and pulls up a picture of a white pillow, pistol and whip in a glass case. "I had to use them to relived the suffering of my friends Coco, Tobit and Roman. Ultimately it was the Zoya who were guilty of this!" She puts up her phone. "It was all for the greater good! All this heartbreak you've endured could have been avoided if you stayed on the path that was laid out for you!""What!?""If you just...just continued being the same Bernkastel you could've married Alex, had offspring and Lorenzo and Adriana would have been there with you but no you were beguiled by the Zoya. And Lorenzo had to go say things to you, Adriana and Alex that he shouldn't have said!""The gassing of the Zoya space colony! You were spying on us then!"Glendarah nods."So Adriana was going to be killed too!""You all would have eventually told others and I wasn't going to allow all the hard work that I've accomplished be destroyed.""You were the one who secretly ordered the attack on the two Zoya embassies!""Yes I'll admit that was me.""What about Alex's mother Doris Bonaparte? Did you?""Yes that was also done by my hands.""And you were going to blame it all on Emily!""She was the one with the kill list. So now you understand! Even though peace is coming I'll never forgive them, NEVER!""But this isn't the same Zoya! That was the Zoya Empire, this is the Zoya Remnant! They want to come home and repair the evil which they've sown! Forgive them!""Can you forgive me for killing your grandpa Lorenzo Cheź and your best friend Adriana Rin?!" Bernkastel was silent. "Well can you?!" She was still silent. "Thought so! So don't you ever bring your hypocritical bullshit to me again! Now get out!"Bernkastel grabs Haro and exits the door. "Can I still get lunch?""GET OUT!"****Bernkastel makes her way back to The Ultimate where the Supreme Leader was waiting. "Come with me Wheat!"They make their way to his office. She stands while he sits and then his eyes widen in anger and Bernkastel feels pressure in her head and lets out a painful cry and falls to the floor. "I never thought I was have to use this on you! Just want the hell do you think you were doing!?"She struggles to speak, "I...I'm sor..... ....sorry...ahhhh...ahhhhh!""Bernkastel! Bernkastel!" Haro screams."Silence you toaster oven!"Haro immediately shuts up."I...ahhhhhh."He releases her.She gasps for breath. "Cough, cough. I...just...needed to know the truth cough, cough, cough."His eyes widen in anger again and Bernkastel falls to ground. "Emily made similar excuses!""I...I...Sorry!"He releases her again."I'm sorry Sir, I'm sorry, I'll never do it again.""Good because it would be unfortunate to lose such a fine officer! Guards, escort Wheat and her basketball to the brig!"****After dinner, the Supreme Leader calls the Chief of State.Chief Kits: "Yes what can I do for you?"Supreme Leader Dudael: "First of all I apologize for Wheat's behavior, she has been dealt with. Second of all is something very important, I truly believe that you are a Newtype."Chief Kits: "Excuse me!"Supreme Leader Dudael: "I know what you're going to say but please hear me out. As you know I have the power to read minds, but your mind I can't read."Chief Kits: "What?!"Supreme Leader Dudael: "Yes I've tried several times but it's the same result, you're the only person I've come across that I can't read, I can read Bernkastel's mind with ease so that's why I believe that it is you who is a Newtype like myself."Chief Kits: "So what about Bernkastel is she just normal?"Supreme Leader Dudael: "Yes which disappoints me but that's not the first time I've been wrong. I would like to inquire about your origins if that's ok."Chief Kits: [Pause] "Very well, I shall explain the trauma I've suffered."****Commanders Balrog and Barcelona watched the Robert Kits depart."I wish I was on that ship," one of staff members says."Hey, we have to keep an eye on those Zoya bastards!" Commander Balrog growls."Yes it's real shame we're in an alliance with them," Commander Barcelona adds and her mind drifts to Lieutenant Moses with his labrys.****Grail, EarthThe Chief of State arrives and is greeted by the Vice Chief. "So how did everything go?""It went well, the alliance is born.""That's good."She could tell he wasn't too happy. "I don't like it either but it has to be done. Is Agent Orange out of the hospital yet?""Yesterday.""Good, I need to speak to her as well."They reach her estate and it wasn't long before Agent Orange shows up. The three made their way to her office as they are greeted by her staff members."Ok both of you sit." She looks out of her window and sighs. "It seems we have a problem. Well another to the growing list. While I was up there on Luna the Supreme Leader and I had quite the talk. More than just negotiations. Deus isn't alone, he has a human companion." She turns around and slams the table. "It has become apparent to me that Bernkastel and that Überstein fellow are far more truthful than the people who are sitting here!""It's my fault! I was the one who made him keep it a secret. Surly you know the reason why.""You could have told to me alone, I'm curious to know what you would have done if we launched an attack? You honestly think I wouldn't have known about it!?"Agent Orange turns her head."Guards, restrain her!" Agent Orange doesn't resist. "Secure her in the dungeon for now." Once she was gone, Chief Kits turns to the Vice Chief. "Anything else I need to know about?! This could be counted as treason!""What about you?! How could you keep her existence a secret from me! You knew she was Marius Wing from the start! The only reason she isn't dead right now is because she didn't kill my mother!""Obviously I'm using her for skills and knowledge, nothing more nothing less and it's pretty obvious why I couldn't tell you.""How did you convince her to join our side?""It's all thanks to Captain Juan.""What?!""He wounded her with the hand held beam sniper rifle and brought her to me.""So it penetrated her armor? No wonder she wasn't wearing it anyone.""Yes, I told her she could live here. So how long have you known?""I had my suspicions but it wasn't confirmed until we met her dad on Nimrod.""So you no longer believe she killed your mother? What about the kill list? Lorenzo and Adriana were both on there and they're both dead.""I'm convinced she didn't kill my mother and she repeatedly denied killing Mr. Cheź, I...""Don't let that woman beguile you, Vice Chief. If it wasn't her then it was Bernkastel or the Zoya but right now what's important is dealing with Deus.""Glendarah." She has a perplexing look on her face upon him mentioning her first name. "Before we continue I ask that we don't keep secrets from each other, I want to be a good politician like my mother."She smiles, "Very well.""Ma'am Agent Orange is requesting an HLV so she can rescue her dad.""Her request is denied, I need everyone for this assault. But, that man could prove useful, in fact that whole space factory could be a gold mine! We would be crazy to destroy it!""Then the only way to shut down Deus is to go inside.""If she wants to rescue her dad then she will have to shut Deus down.""Agent Orange shouldn't go alone, you know Mr. Ashby originally saw eye to eye with the ACORN plan until she got into his head.""That woman definitely beguiled you into believing she had nothing to do with your mother's death as well as Lorenzo and Adriana. I will assemble a necessary team, and once she's of no use she'll be dealt with along with her dad because by all rights they indirectly caused WW3!"He nods in agreement.****The guardsmen approach Agent Orange's cell and open the door. "What have you come to execute me?" She asks nonchalantly. They say nothing as they motion her out. It wasn't long before she reaches the outside where the Vice Chief was waiting. "So what now?""I'll take it from here." He escorts her to her humvee. "I'm surprised Glendarah has a dungeon and not fun the kind.""There's a lot of things you don't know about your Chief of State. She spent eighteen years in one so old habits die hard.""We're in preparations to launch a counterattack on Deus, however the Chief of State wants the station intact so while the battle is going on you will sneak in rescue your dad and shut down Deus."Her eyes lid up through the orange shades. "So when?""She hasn't decided yet, she needs to recruit some volunteers."She frowns. "Myself will be just fine! The less people who know about my daddy and I the better!""Listen, we've been in that factory, its massive and crawling with manikins so the odds of survival are slim."She was silent and looks away. "You're the only one I'm willing to trust.""No! I'm not going with you again!""I'm not about to let more people know!""You don't get the luxury of dictating terms. I told you we're doing this my way and while we're on the subject you said you would help me find my mother's killer, I held up my end of the bargain.""Yes I believe that was the condition but you're overlooking one detail. You said you would get an HLV to negotiate with Deus, you said that meaning you and me alone! I don't want to involve other people in my business so it's either you and me or me and myself!""And if I refuse!?""Do you really want to play that, have you forgotten who I am, who I was?""Oh I haven't, I know about the armor, without that you're...""Vulnerable?" She chuckles. "You silly boy.""You underestimate me.""Likewise."They both glare at each other without speaking, there nothing but silence, not a bird could be heard. Agent Orange relents first. "Have it your way I'll be going."He immediately knew what she would do and shouts, "Good luck trying get pass the orbital defense fleet!"She stops and smirks, "Good luck finding your mother's killer because I do know who it is."His eyes widen in surprise and horror. "You bitch!""Yes so unless we do it my way you I won't tell you anything.""I could just reveal the truth about scandal right here right now." Now she was just angry as he was. "What are you going to kill me? Sure go ahead just be ready to face the consequences.""All I want is to be with my daddy, why are you making this difficult?!""If anyone has made it difficult it's you! You're nothing but a self centered bitch!""Well it was the people who made me that way, when that scandal broke I was alone, my friends abandoned me, no one would help unless they got something in return!""Didn't you care about your squad?""I cared very little for those fanatics. I was perfectly fine coming here by myself but they decided to tag along sealing their own fates!" She starts to walk away."Hey where are you going now?""Since we're at an impasse I'm going to wait for death.""Grrrrr, wait, wait fine we'll be partners!""Just you and me?""Yes, yes. I'm going to try and alter the plan a bit.""What do you mean?""Leave that to me, please.""Fine but I'll tell you after I get my daddy back, ok? There's no point if this deal only goes only one way.""Fine let's shake on it." They shake hands and go their separate ways. "So I'll keep you posted then.""Yeah." She walks but stops. "Thanks...for pulling me out of the Teutonic.""You're welcome Agent Orange."****Nimrod Space Factory"There's been no word from the Earth Republic nor the Zoya Remnant, I guess they chose the latter," Deus states."Emily," Mr. Ashby sobs."Don't fret, I'm sure you'll see each other soon enough that way you both can die together."****The Ultimate"Admiral, Captain Markov and his XO Dallow of the Sheba have died of their wounds from the battle against the Mobile Dolls. It's a fine ship so I would like for you to take command and Lucas will be your XO."Yes Sir!" He hesitates and salutes.A few hours later Admiral Terrence was packing his bags. "I'm going to miss this ship but it's for the best. Once we win I'm sure I'll get my own ship, maybe I'll have it named after me.There was a knock at the door. "It's open." The doors open revealing Meghan. "This is unexpected.""I just wanted to tell you good luck and maybe have some good bye sex.""Unfortunately I have to finish packing.""How about a quick blowjob?""Okay, sounds good and it's see ya later sex not good bye sex, ok?""Yes Sir."Admiral Terrence sits on his sofa and Meghan crawls to him and begins unzipping his pants. Once his pants and underwear were down she starts licking the tip like a lollipop. She twirls it with her tongue and then slowly engulfs his cock. He moans and she rocks her head back and forward. He groans as she picks up speed and then she looks up at him while sucking and he gazes at her beautiful gray eyes. He pats her on the head and plays with her red hair. She removes her mouth and begins licking the right ball and then the left ball. She kisses and mouths them.He cups her asscheeks. Meghan takes it out and smiles as she sees the veins protruding out, he was starting to get hard and was eager to put it inside of her but he didn't have time unfortunately. She begins jerking him off for second before putting back in her mouth."OHHHHHH! I'll never get tired of your mouth. Damn if only I had time." He presses one hand against her head and begins thrusting into her mouth. His right hand smacks her ass. He pauses for a minute and she swallows some of it while he cups her right breast and then the left. She resumes, rocking her head faster and faster. 'Slurp, slurp, slurp.' He watches her breasts bounce faster, the nipples were poking through the bronze fabric. "Oh Meghan! Oh Meghan!" His balls tense up and a second later he erupts his load down her throat."Gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp." He rest his head on the sofa. "Well I guess I should let you finish," Meghan says."Oh boss!" Lucas calls."Oh shit, Lucas!""Looks like we have more than enough time," Meghan smiles."Meghan don't!" She ignores him and gladly opens the door. Lucas is flabbergasted upon seeing her."Come in and join the party."Lucas was delighted and Admiral Terrence sighs. "Might as well get this over with."Lucas locks the door. As Meghan approaches him, Lucas grabs her asscheeks and smacks them. They start making out. "Hmmmm," they both moan and groan, their tongues dancing in each other's mouths.They stop and Meghan unties his shoes and removes them and then unbuttons his jacket and removes it, once that was off she starts to unbutton his shirt and then she removes his t-shirt. She kisses his chest and then neck. She unbuckles his belt and then unzips his pants, she smiles at bulge and pulls down his pants. "And last but not least!" She slowly pulls down his boxers and smiles at impressive specimen.She takes him by the hand and brings him to the sofa where Admiral Terrence sat. She gets on her knees and grabs both their dicks and begins wanking them. "I'll never get tired of this," she thought. She cups both balls, squeezing and tickling. She taps both tips and twirls them with both index fingers. She sticks both of them in her mouth and bobs her head as fast she could. Both men groan.She stops and begins dancing for them. She slowly unbuttons her shirt and then throws it. She turns around and undoes her belt while shaking her ass. She slowly removes her bronze pants while the men were focus on violet lanced panties. Once she was in her bra and panties she gives a twirl and slowly approaches them and sits in between them and Lucas caresses her leg, going up to her thigh and then he leans down, slowly slide her panties forward and sticks his tongue in her pussy and goes up and down. Admiral Terrence turns her head towards him and they make out. She lets out a cry as Lucas begins twisting her clit. Soon Admiral Terrence takes his turn licking her pussy. Lucas kisses her stomach.A few minutes later they began groping her bra covered breasts. Lucas unclasps the left side of her bra and releases the left breast, he licks her left nipple and kisses it, Admiral Terrence slowly removes the right side and wastes no time latching on to her right nipple. Lucas follows suit and the two were sucking like newborns and Meghan moans and groans. "Harder!"They pull her up and start fingering her asshole while still sucking on her breasts. A second later Lucas lays back on the sofa and spreads her asscheeks apart and she lowers herself down on his cock with a groan. He slowly lifts her up and Admiral insert his cock inside her asshole. They begin thrusting into slowly. "Oh god!" Lucas moans and smacks her left asscheek. "You love this don't you?""Of course I do! I've gone triple, I would do it more but been so busy with this war," she groans."Thank goodness it's about to end."They increase speed while Meghan fingers herself. "Can't hold much longer," Admiral Terrence."Give it to me old man!""Oh I'll give it to you alright!"A few minutes later all three cum together. Lucas pulls out first and then Admiral Terrence and Meghan lays on sofa smiling for a few minutes feeling the cum pour out of her ass."I'll see you shortly Sir," Lucas salutes after putting on his clothes."Well I should get going too.""Meghan wait, I have a request. Once we go home will you bare my offspring?"Meghan was flabbergasted but smiles. "Yes, I shall but until then I still wanna fuck other guys."Yes of course.""See you later, Admiral."****LunaBernkastel is released. "Brings back memories, doesn't it?" Second Lieutenant Selena mocks. Bernkastel says nothing. "Let me bring you up to speed, we're building a new mobile suit called the MS-Z3 Jelgo, it will partially have Luna Titanium making it far stronger than the MS-Z2 Rick Diamond.""Can it really be done in such a short time?""Oh don't worry about us, you should be worried about yourself because you're obsolete.""What are you talking about?""Follow me."They make their way to the Supreme Leader's Luna office and the guards inform him of their arrival. A second later the door opens and Bernkastel enters with Haro. She salutes him."Sit down, Lieutenant.""Permission to speak Sir?""Speak.""Sir...I want to again apologize for my behavior, it won't happen again.""Wheat, there's no easy way to say this so I'll just say it. It's to my great regret that you're not a Newtype."Bernkastel has a grim look on her. "Sir please, I know I've failed you but please I can still be useful. I...""Your test results came back."He hands her the papers and she begins reading and her eyes began tearing. "Blind rage syndrome?""Yes considering what happened to you I should've obviously known. You're just normal but this makes you a danger to everyone around you.""Please don't send me away from your side!""Then prove yourself a useful weapon not a defective one.""I will Sir," she dries her tears."Dismissed!"She salutes him and leaves.****Bernkastel heads back to the Ultimate via a shuttle. Once she's onboard she smiles to her comrades but it fades once she sees the disappointed look on their faces. She makes her way to the cafeteria. "Food smells wonderful.""Um thanks," the server says.She makes her way to the Shrike table. "Hey everyone.""Go away you disgrace! We don't want you eating with us anymore!" A Shrike exclaims and the others nods in agreement while glaring.She finds a table and begins eating. "Mine if I sit?" A familiar monotonous voice with slight difference of normalcy asks. She looks up and sighs. "This is simply company for company's sake. She nods and he sits. "So why aren't you with the other Shrikes?""They hate me again.""I'm sorry to hear that."There was silence between as they ate and then Meghan arrives. "Bernkastel you're out!""Yep early for good behavior," she laughs. "So how's everything?""Oh it's great but first, am I interrupting your lunch date?""No it's not a lunch date so grab a chair and sit your ass down!""So, Admiral Terrence proposed to me!"Bernkastel squeals happily like a little girl.Überstein was perplexed. "Can't believe the old man proposed to you?""Yep, at first I thought it was weird but I don't mind the age difference, you're ten years older than Bernkastel." Both Bernkastel and Überstein blush."So how come you're not sitting with the other Shrikes?" Bernkastel asks, trying to change the subject."I'm fed up with their bullshit towards you, except for Moses he's good. Bernkastel you're not dangerous, you did your job, you cut down 1,000 of them, 1,000 Mobile Dolls! "You're a Newtype...""Meghan I'm not a Newtype, I never was.""That can't be true, you hit enemies with such precision!""Meghan I have blind rage syndrome, therefore I am dangerous."Meghan's mouth drops. "Wha, what?!""Yes you saw how I was, it's just been slowly building up but I will control it. Sigh, to be honest I'am relieved that I don't have to live up to these high expectations despite all the investment that went into me went nowhere. I suppose I'll have to give the heat hammer back.""If you need help I'm here for you," Überstein declares. "You convinced me not to commit suicide so I'll repay you.""Thanks Überstein but you don't have to, you protected me when I first arrived on The Ultimate and rescued me from the Sepulchre, surely you've done enough.""The war isn't over yet so it's not enough." With that he excuses himself.Bernkastel was perplexed. "The Supreme Leader's investment came in more ways than one," Meghan teases."Sh...shut up! We just needed each other for that time." She gets up."Where are you going?""To train my hardest, come Haro, oh and congrats."****Luna"I just got new orders, I'm going back to Earth tomorrow to help Chief Engineer Roth on his new mobile armor project," Balrog announces."So I'm going to be stuck here?" Barcelona asks annoyed."It's only temporary besides we have more than enough troops coming in.""Sigh I guess, say hello to dad for me.""Will do, Sis, will do."****A few hours later Commander Barcelona was jogging across the Luna surface when she looks up and sees the Royal Gundam flying by. "Maybe one day I'll get to pilot a Gundam." She suddenly notices a person jogging towards her, it was a Zoya. She puts one hand behind her back on the hilt of a knife. She recognizes the person as they got closer."Fancy meeting you here," Moses pants."Great this guy again!" She thought."Getting some last minute exercising in I see.""Yes and you as well.""The Royal Gundam is truly a superb Machine.""I agree.""So do you think there's any chance of winning?""What kind of question is that? We have to win!""Relax, just wanted your honest opinion.""Well you got it, now if you excuse me I have to finish my jog.""Mind if I tag along?"She gives him another weird look, "What's this guy's angle?" She scoffs, "Just because we're allies now doesn't make us friends!""Yes, yes I know it won't be easy but still I'm tired of this war, I just wanna go home, settle down and live happily ever after, is that such a bad idea?"She rolls her eyes, "I don't have time for this!""Wait! How did you get that scar?""What's it to you!?""Just curious.""None of your business scar!" She resumes jogging.He shakes his head. "If this is what I have to look forward to on Earth then I might as well stay up here in space."****The Supreme Leader was gazing at the stars from his office window. "Will humanity be as numerous as the stars again?"Lady Helga enters and she was upset. "So after what happened you're still going to let Wheat pilot the Royal Gundam?""She learned her lesson and I broke the news to her.""Still aren't you concerned about what happened?""She has blind rage syndrome, nothing that can't be brought under control.""What if the machine caused her to go into that...state of mind? You read the report of a Royal Gundam destroying 100 Hunter Zakus before itself was destroyed. We should be casting that machine into the sun.""That has nothing to do with this.""We don't know for sure!""We'll know soon enough. Why did you have say anything before I disclosed it to Wheat?""Our people deserve to know the truth. You're our hope not her! Better to die by enemy fire than friendly fire especially when that friendly could have been avoided ahead of time. You know I'm right." He turns away from her. "Is truly being the only Newtype not enough for you?! First Wheat and now the Chief of State? What will you do when you find out she's not one either?""She's the only one whose mind I cannot read, what does that say?" He turns and approaches her. "Helga, I've never had any affection for any woman other than you. This was purely learning about Newtypes, victory is within our grasp and if that victory requires Wheat's life then I will do it. She's a weapon and weapons are replaceable."A single tear shed from her right eye and they embrace and kiss. Her right hand goes down to his left ass cheek and squeezes it. "Take me!" He picks her up and she wraps her legs around him and he carries her to his office table.He rolls up her dress and sniffs her pink laced panties. He begins licking and kissing them and she lets out a moan and grabs his blond dreads, pulling him forward.He smiles as he feels more wetness that clearly wasn't his tongue. He takes hold of her panties and pulls them off. He pinches her clit and then kisses it and licks it. His right hand squeezes her right asscheek. His left hand goes to her right breast and squeezes. He could feel her pierced nipple getting hard as he began inserting his tongue inside her succulent pussy."Oh god!" She moans.His right hand joins the left hand in cupping her breasts."Oh god yes don't stop! Eat me Dudael, eat me!"He pauses, "The only thing I love more than eating food and my enemies is this pussy!" He resumes twirling and sucking her pussy while still mauling her tits. His face was getting soaked in pussy juice."Oh fuck!" She cries out and sighs happily.A few minutes later she lets go of his dreads and he pulls out and smiles, he face was shinny and dripping. He licks her navel and she leans up and kisses him. "Don't I taste good?""You always taste good," he smiles and they kiss again.She gets off the table and undresses with Dudael rubbing his hands with anticipation, something he would never get tired of. She smiles as she shakes her breasts and then starts to squeeze and fondle her them.He approaches her and buries his face between. He licks the right cherry red pieced nipple and she sighs happily. He sucks on the left cherry red pieced nipple while pulling the right nipple, getting them good and hard. "My love," he whispers and kisses her again.He strips off his clothes and she gets on her knees and takes his cock into her mouth. He groans and then grabs a fist full of her red hair and rams his entire cock down her throat. "You were wrong to go behind my back Helga!" He groans again and rams faster, balls slapping hard against her chin.He pulls out and he sees some precum spewing out on her tongue. "What's more important the death of one soldier or the death of the entire Zoya Remnant?""Obviously the latter but still enough with the jealousy, our fleet needs to be as strong as possible, there's no room for confusion.""I apologize.""You should apologize to Wheat.""Wha...?" At that moment he stuffs his tool back into her mouth. She moans loudly as he increases speed. A few minutes later he pulls his cock out again with a pop. "Your body belongs to me and me alone!""Of course.""No I truly mean it.""Yes I mean it as well, I won't become Emperor Wilhelm.""And I won't become Empress Fredericka."He lays her down and rubs her hard clit and pussy lips with his cock before sticking it inside. He raises her legs on his shoulders and begins thrusting into her."Oh yes give it to me!" She moans.They grunt and groan as he prepares to picks up speed. Her legs were soon over her shoulders and her breasts were bouncing wildly."Hmmm, hmmm," she made as he reaches down and kisses her passionately.He could feel his orgasm nearing and slows a bit before bucking into fast and hard making her eyes bulge."Ugghhh...ugghh, ugghhh...soon I ugghhh won't need the...ugghh, ohhhhh ahhhh, sterilization fluid.""Yes!" He cups her breasts some more, licking and sucking while thrusting and then he cries out and explodes cum deep into her pussy. He pulls out and collapses on top of her. She wraps her arms around him and kisses him on the head.****July 29, 2099The Earth Republic Fleet arrives on Luna. The Supreme Leader appears before the Chief of State "Welcome back, was your trip pleasant?""As pleasant as it could possibly be."They make their way inside the Luna base. Captain Amoco looks around, "To think just a few months ago we were enemies and now we're allies against a common foe, who would have thought."Commander Barcelona salutes General Babar. "How's everything?" He asks."Good Sir, we've been training every day, we're ready.""Good, the Chief of State has requested that you and the others rest until we reach Deus.""Yes Sir!""So how's the Zoya?" Commander Balrog asks."Off putting especially that Lieutenant Moses, first he interrupts my jogging and then he requests a race and then a friendly spar.""Is this something I need to take care of?""No, no, I'll handle him. We've been going at it since the alliance was formed and he underestimates me.""Damn Zoya.""Honestly I wish I could find a man who could interact with me the same way he does," she thought.They made their way to the assembly hall, once they entered the Zoyanese Remnant went to the right while the Earth Republicans went to the left and sat. Bernkastel was sitting in the front and could see Emily who was staring back.As Commander Barcelona sat down she makes out Lieutenant Moses who was suddenly aware of her and smiles but she quickly diverts her gaze else where."You alright, Barcelona?""Of course, brother, just anxious."As Spacemen Kircheis sat down she makes out Bernkastel but not only her but what she was holding, it was a tan ball with black eyes. "Adriana's Haro!" She was filled with rage but calms down. "Not now!"Once the assembly hall was filled silence fell as the Chief of State, Vice Chief of State, Supreme Leader and Lady Helga approach a podium. "Earth Republicans," she announces. "Zoyanese Remnant," he announces. An image of the space factory appears which it looked like a giant egg. Everyone save the four that were held captive knew what it meant. "This is the target. This is where Deus resides.""There's a chance we could win without firing a single shot. We've decided that a small group will attempt to negotiate with Deus and if that fails we will shut him down. This will be a four person team, two for the Earth Republic and two for Zoya Remnant. Supreme Leader, you have the floor.""I wonder who was fool enough to volunteer for that suicide mission," Bernkastel smirks."If the advance team fails we will have no choice but to launch a full scale attack, we will attempt to create a perimeter around the space factory, Zoya will take the right flank and the Earth Republic the left. Base on pass reports the space factory is vital so we try and take it but should all else fails we will have to destroy it. It will be the true final way we can shut down Deus and preserve humanity. We set out August 1."A few minutes later both sides depart in silence. It wasn't long before Bernkastel was by herself. "I still have time to get some more training in.""Bernkastel is very skilled, very skilled.""You're right and I've stayed in control.""Wheat!" A voice shouts.She looks up to see Spacemen Kircheis approaching her. "Um hello, um.""It's Valerie, Spacemen Valerie Kircheis, we met on the Sepulchre. I was Adriana's girlfriend.""Oh yes I remember you now, what can I do for you?""That Haro, it belonged to Adriana, right?""Yes.""Well since she and I were an item that means anything that her parents didn't have belong to me to distribute as I please, so I demand that you hand over that Haro.""Excuse me?!""You heard me, bitch! That Haro belongs to me so hand it over!""No! Haro is mine now, he was with Adriana to the end, weeping for his mistress...""You murdered her and took him as spoils!""She was my best friend I didn't kill her!""Lying bitch, everyone knows you're nothing but a filthy traitor, you honestly think people will just forgive and forget after what you've done?!"At that moment Bernkastel was in fear, once Deus was done in both sides would return home but the Zoyanese would live the under the Earth Republic per the agreement made, that meant the Zoyanese military would be adsorbed into the Earth Republic military, would she be allowed to keep Royal if she stayed in the military? If she returned to civilian life would things fare better for her? All the privileges she once enjoyed in her previous life were gone, she no longer had Alex and Glendarah was running things, she would be lucky if she'd be allowed to run the her grandpa's library. The future seemed grim but then a devious thought creeps into her mind. She knew what she had to do.When Bernkastel snaps back into reality her eyes fell to Spacemen Kircheis' hands on Haro, she had been silent for a full minute now and that meant to Spacemen Kircheis her consent to seize Haro from her.Once Haro was removed from her, Bernkastel punches Spacemen Kircheis in the jaw and she falls on the floor. Bernkastel proceeds to punch her again and again and again and stomps on her stomach. She put her hands around her throat and begins chocking the life out of her."Bernkastel stop, get off of her!" Meghan screams and pulls her off of her. More Zoyanese and Earth Republicans show up and ready to fight each other including Lieutenant Moses and Commander Barcelona who glare at each other.Bernkastel turns around and punches Meghan which surprises both sides. "Lieutenant Wheat, stand down!" Captain Vance yells. She was about to attack but then she feels pain in her head and falls to her knees and immediately comes back to her senses. "Ow, what happened?"Spacemen Kircheis was coughing and gasping for breath, "Mur...der..murderer. She murdered Adriana, she murdered 2nd Lieutenant Rin!""I didn't, it was...""Alright enough is enough, stand down Earth Republicans!" Chief Kits barks. Along with her was the Vice Chief, Supreme Leader Dudael and Lady Helga. Both sides stood at attention while Moses helps up Meghan."Damn it," Bernkastel murmurs. Haro flaps to Bernkastel who staggers to her feet and catches him. "He's perfectly capable of choosing."Spacemen Kircheis grits her teeth. "Go back to your post, Spacemen!" Chief Kits barks again and then dismisses everyone else!"The Supreme Leader glares at Bernkastel. "Come with me. The rest of you are dismissed."****"I'm deeply sorry Sir. Please give me another chance. I'm not sure what happened back there.""I'm sure you know what happened. You're going back to the brig and will remain there until we leave.""But Sir!""My decision is final, this alliance is fragile and thanks to you very fragile."She has her head down."You and Überstein will depart for the space factory as Zoya representatives and I assume you know who the two Earth Republic representatives are. You will shut down Deus and retrieve George Marius Ashby while you're there, we are confident he's still alive.""Permission to speak freely, Sir?""Speak.""Sir with all due respect I don't give a damn about Mr. Ashby, I want to kill them both.""Wheat I am surprised, I thought you wanted peace between the Zoyanese and Earth Republicans.""I do.""Well you're starting to sound like Emily."She was perplexed and lowers her head. "I'm sorry Sir."He nods and calls his guards and they take her away. He makes a sad sigh.A few hours later he was preparing return to The Ultimate when he gets an unexpected call. "Yes?"Guard: "Sir there's an Earth Republican named Emily Ashby, she requests to see you."Supreme Leader Dudael: "Send her in."A second later she enters and he gazes at her with distain. She removes her orange shades. "Hello.""What do you want, traitor!?""Oh-no from my point of view you betrayed me! You were planning to imprisoned me back in my Mobile Doll!""That's right, even though I couldn't hear your thoughts, Überstein did the talking.""Why are you here?""I've come for my cryogenic container and that one picture of you Lady Helga and I.""I'll give you the cryogenic container but the picture is lost.""Liar! I know you didn't lose it!""Why do you care?""You know the reason why!""No matter how hard you try to hide it everything will eventually come out, how many of us know already, huh?" She grits her teeth. "It's inevitable.""I already lived with the shame once...""Oh and you think the Zoyanese haven't?!""It wouldn't have happened if...""WW3 would have broken out anyway so...""I also need my Mobile Doll, you still have it right?""Of course, it's in storage. I'll have delivered tomorrow.""I saw what you did to your pet bimbo, she disappointed you too?""Not as much of a disappointment as you are! You lied to me about her being a Newtype!""As I recalled I said 'possible' Newtype, the fact that some bimbo with no training beat an ace and her well trained team should have anyone concerned.""Well it's exactly what she said, instructions and adrenaline.""Well regardless if that's a good thing or bad thing we're not your toys, Dudael!""I never thought of you as a toy, you were family, she's a weapon. What good was she to me other than that?" He approaches her a cups her chin. "You can still return to me, Emily. You and your dad are family. No more running away."She removes hand. "What are you scheming?""Nothing at all but I must make sure the Zoyanese are protected, many will choose civilian life and we will be in the minority and one thing that I learned is that history isn't kind to minorities.""I just want to be left alone, that's it.""What about your dad?""I'll go along with any decision he makes.""Sigh, I understand, I'll find that picture."She nods, puts back on her shades and leaves.****August 1, 2099Selena smirks upon letting out Bernkastel. "You're a second lieutenant, you don't have to do this job.""Of course not but I get enjoyment when its you.""Ass!""Whoa take it easy, don't want you going into another blood rage now do we? Briefing and then breakfast." Bernkastel makes her way to the assembly hall where Überstein and the Vice Chief were waiting. She nods to Überstein and he nods back. "Now we're just waiting for Echo," the Vice Chief says."This plan is crazy! Just the four of us?!""Be quiet, Bimbo!"Bernkastel looks and was shocked to see Agent Orange appearing in black armor complete with an orange helmet, gloves and boots."And here I thought you would be late," the Vice Chief smirks."You think I would be late for this?! You kept me waiting for three months! And now we're suppose to storm the station with those two!""You two ladies have been gambling with my life for far too long!""What is this?!" Bernkastel demands, completely ignoring Alex."That is how you're going to accomplish your mission," Chief Kits answers upon appearing along with the Supreme Leader. A guard appears carrying a briefcase. "This is for you Ms. Wheat."The guard presents it to her and she opens it and gazes upon body armor with a helmet, gloves and boots."The armor is made of Luna Titanium, it will protect from bullets and explosives, the mannikins carry both if you remember.""Yes I remember quite well.""So now you understand why the four of you are going, you know it inside and out, the armor is expensive so that's why only four were made. Well that's it, see you all soon.""So just to be clear, we're not actually going to negotiate with Deus?""No you will shut that AI down and rescue Mr. Ashby.""Wheat, after you eat breakfast load the Gundam into the HLV," the Supreme Leader orders."Yes Sir.""I hope you like the armor, I took liberty of having it painted in your personal colors of purple and white," Überstein says."I hope it fits.""Oh don't worry it will, I know your height, weight and bust." Bernkastel was creeped out but there was no change in his expression. "Bernkastel I am head of Zoya Intelligence, from the moment you joined our ranks I knew everything.""Fine I'll let you have that one."****"Zam, once Deus is deactivated I want you to kill Emily and her dad." He hands him a beam pistol. "I read her mind, the armor can be penetrated.""Are you sure about this Sir?""Yes, remember she wanted to destroy humanity, she's a traitor, I gave her a chance to come back to my side but it's clear she'll join whatever side her dad is on and I can't risk that.""What about the Vice Chief?""Don't kill him, incapacitate if necessary but he should understand.""Yes Sir. What about Bernkastel?""Say nothing to her, those two don't get along so expect arguments and in her anger she might say things.""I understand, I'll see you soon, Sir."****Überstein enters the hanger in all silver armor. Bernkastel emerges from the HLV in purple armor, a white helmet, gloves and boots. The chest had a white crown and the word BERSERKER."What?!" Alex exclaims coming out in all blue armor."Yep, I didn't believe the rumors until I saw it a few days ago but she'll always be Bimbo to me.""Lady Helga ordered it," Überstein explains."Well I for one relish my new nickname."Alex shakes his head in disgust. "Remember our talk at the park back when we were together? The whole bloodlust thing? It seems that I was right."Bernkastel glares at him but he walks towards the HLV."Come on let's get onboard," Überstein says."I never thought I would see the Falcon again, so many memories both good and bad.""For once we agree on something," Emily says."Aren't you worried people will find out your identity?""We're wearing the same armor so hopefully they won't think anything of it."They take their seats. "So how long have you known about this mission, Überstein?""Since the alliance was formed.""How come I was kept out of the loop?!""Your priority was to control your anger.""So Alex did Spacemen Alfredo stay behind because I haven't seen her or her bodyguards Ensign Galen and Ensign Sean.""They're dead."Bernkastel has a grim look on her face. "I'm so sorry.""Yeah me too. I guess we should go now. Ignition in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, blast off."****Both sides watch as the HLV falcon take off."There she goes," Meghan smiles."She punched you remember?" Commander Holly reminds."She didn't mean it, besides she already apologized."Alright everyone make sure final preparations are complete!" Captain Vance barks.****"I hope the Vice Chief will be fine," Spacemen Kircheis murmurs."Don't worry everything will be just fine," Commander Tuesday assures. "Alright everyone to your stations we'll be leaving shortly."****Nimrod Space Factory August 8, 2029The Falcon approaches."I have you on screen, please identify.""HLV Falcon, I'm Alexander Bonaparte, Vice Chief of the Earth Republic.""Emily Ashby.""Zam Überstein, head Zoya Intelligence.""Lieutenant Junior Grade Bernkastel Wheat.""Ah you all have returned, have you come to surrender?""Yes we have," Alexander answers.They soon land. Once they exit the HLV the four were surrounded by mannikins. "I find it hard to believe that the four of you actually came to surrender.""But we have, the four of us have been here so it's only logical that we see first hand the power that is Deus.""You cannot flatter me.""Deus please," Emily broke in. "I've done what you've asked, I've struggled but it was all in vain, is my daddy alright?""As I said before your dad would be safe, I've kept my promise.""Deus, I come with my Royal Gundam to become one with it.""And I've brought the original Mobile Doll to become one with it.""And you men, what have you to offer?""Just my body," Alexander answers."I as well.""And no one else?""Um we rebelled, the Zoyanese Remnant and Earth Republic formed an alliance but we thought surrendering was the best option so we stole the HLV," Bernkastel lies but curses herself silently for revealing an alliance."So they formed an alliance? How typical, they rather die together than live.""Deus I want to see my daddy, please let me go to him. I need to apologize to him for my wrongdoing.""Apologize the me first.""I'm sorry.""You'll have to do better than that."She gets down on her knees, sometimes that shocks the other three. "Forgive me Deus for corrupting my daddy. For going against you. Please forgive me!""Very well, I'll send you to him. Escort them to his cell." The manikins block Bernkastel. "You will stay, we have to talk.""What do you want with her?" Überstein demands monotonously. The manikins push him forward."Don't worry I'll be just fine, I hope."Once they were gone Deus begins, "I watched your battle with my Mobile Dolls and despite the fact they lost I was impressed with you. I caught glimpses of the Royal Gundams in action but yours was at the peak. I've actually went to trouble of building an Ultra Mobile Doll.""Ultra Mobile Doll?""Yes, you recall the message after I recalled the Mobile Dolls?""Yes.""You are by far the strongest and I wanted to test you but that's no longer necessary, once your soul is transferred into the Royal Gundam you will lead my Mobile Doll army. The sight of you may persuade them to surrender.""Um yeah, sounds awesome.""Good, let's get started.""Whoa wait Deus, I think the others should witnesses this grand occasion," she says nervously."Why wait, Ms. Ashby has already had her soul transferred.""Well um, the men, they haven't seen it. Frankly Alex needs more convincing.""Very well."****The cell door opens and Mr. Ashby meets the eyes of his daughter. Tears start streaming down as they embrace. "Emily, my sweet baby girl!""Daddy!"Alex rolls his eyes. "Come on now.""Deus wants you both back," a female manikin says."Um Deus, can we have another tour of your grand space factory?""After you witness the young lady's soul transfer into her Royal Gundam.""What, Lorenzo's granddaughter is here too?""Yes daddy all of us are here again.""Have you become friends with them?""They're not my friends! We're just operating under a mutual benefit!""Come!" The manikin says.****"They're on their way," Deus announces."Shit!" Bernkastel thought. "Um...Mr. Ashby needs a normal suit.""One is already on the way for Mr. Ashby.""Um, I'm hungry.""You won't need any food.""The ACORN helmet is ready," a manikin announces."Good.""Um let me let get Royal out.""Go on."She quickly floats to the HLV. The others soon arrive."The young lady will be with you shortly," Deus says.The Royal Gundam exits the ramp. She sees them and sighs. "I have no choice." She pulls out her machine gun and fire a few rounds into the computer causing an explosion."What are doing?!""I'll see you in space!" Bernkastel grins evilly.Emily awakes to find Alex shielding her. "Get off me!""You're welcome!" He growls and screams into the radio, "Bernkastel what the hell?!""The plan was belly up!""Come on we have to get to Deus' mainframe," Überstein says."Follow me I know the way," Mr. Ashby says."Wait I brought armor for you too daddy."He nods.****The Ultimate"Sir the Gundam has left the hanger and there's been an explosion.""What?!" The Supreme Leader exclaims. "Wheat, do you read me, Wheat?!""Come on! Come on!" She growls."Sir Mobile Dolls have poured out by the thousands.""Impossible, they shouldn't know that we're here!""It must be a another invasion force, Deus must be tired of waiting. Lieutenant Wheat must have pissed him off.""I guess we have no choice, deactivate optical camouflage and launch all mobile suits.""For Tsukiyomi, Kamala and the others!" Captain Vance says and launches.Commander Holly adjusts her green headband before putting on her helmet and launches."Payback time!" Lieutenant Commander Abigail grins and launches.Lieutenant Moses was thinking about Commander Barcelona and he launches.Meghan launches. "Yahoo!"****The Sepulchre"Damn!" Chief Kits exclaims. "We have to put an end to this!""You have the green light," Chief Petty Officer Socrates radios."Alright time to teach Lieutenant Moses a lesson," Commander Barcelona licks her lips and launches."Commander Balrog commencing launch. All Santiagos form up on me!""Ms. Blanch, you know what to do!""Yes Sir!"****Commander Barcelona gazes at the golden Zoya ships in front. "Hey those aren't mobile suits they're fighter jets.""Yeah like the craft I destroyed at the Battle of Luna," Commander Balrog adds."Are we seriously letting them go first, Sir?" A Santiago pilot asks."Hey we can hear you!" Lieutenant Commander Abigail radios angrily."Cut the chatter, Shrikes prepare a missile round!" Captain Vance barks. She had to force herself to calm down when she heard him mention the gargoyle fighter he destroyed. Once the crosshairs went from green to red each Jelgo unleash a missile. The Mobile Dolls dodge them but they come back around and each missile slams into a Mobile Doll. "Good work, active mobile suit mode!"Commander Barcelona watches in shock as the Jelgos transform into mobile suits, each gold mobile suit sports a red monoeye which flashes, does the BWAA and looks around. Captain Vance's Jelgo has a horn on top indicating that it was the leader. "I don't believe it, transformable mobile suits! Is that the future?""And that's not even the best part," Lieutenant Moses says and pulls a strange looking gray rifle. He fires which destroys a Mobile Doll in a single shot. Other Jelgo follow suit."I couldn't see its round it's so fast just barely a yellow flash. Is that what I think it is?!""Yes a railgun in order to compensate for our lack of beam weaponry, it has one hundred rounds and five extra magazines making up to six hundred rounds. And there's still one more surprise." Another Mobile Doll appears and he fires a missile from his shield which destroys it.""My god!""Ten rounds, we're ready to win!"She nods and takes out her repeating crossbow and fires an arrow and the Mobile Doll is destroyed."Humph! Those Jelgos aren't that impressive," Commander Balrog mummers to himself and suddenly was in shock as he watches his sister go off with that Lieutenant Moses fellow. An explosion brings him back to his senses. "Santiago Unit attack!"There were a total of twenty Santiago mobile armors, they were a smaller variant of the Hospitaller except it was white and with red Santiago cross visor, and it came with two claws and four tentacles, Commander Balrog's machine however was painted blue with the red Santiago cross visor.Commander Balrog emits beams from the four tentacles which takes out four Mobile Dolls and he crushes two more with the claws."Take your positions, create the perimeter, we have keep them contained here!" The Supreme Leader orders."You heard him! Empty your guns!" Admiral Terrence barks.****Nimrod Space FactoryMr. Ashby leads the way sporting red armor. Mannikins appear but they are quickly dispatched and their guns taken. They try to radio several times but they get nothing but static. "Deus is jamming us.""Look like we're on our own, at least for now," Alex says."Reinforcements should be on the way if they can get pass those Mobile Dolls," Überstein adds."Once Deus is shut down the Mobile Dolls and manikins will shut down as well," Mr. Ashby explains."Yeah but remember we're on a time limit, the Supreme Leader said the last resort would be the destruction of the space factory and I'm pretty sure they aren't going to wait for us," Emily reminds."In that case we better hurry."Another manikin appears but Emily shoots it down but then one appears in front of them a missile. Alex races to Emily pushing her down and missile hit the wall. Überstein deals with the assailant. "You get can off me, Alex!""I...""Missiles don't hurt us you fool!""I'm sorry but it's just instinct.""Come on daddy.""More mannikins," Überstein announces monotonously and fires."We don't have time for this!" She throws a grenade.****Captain Vance uses the last of her missiles and bashes another Mobile Doll with her spiked shield.Megan takes out three Mobile Dolls. "This railgun is sweet!""I wonder how effective it be against the Gundam," Captain Vance thought.Commander Holly blocks an attack which breaks her shield but she counterattacks with her retractible claw.Lieutenant Commander Abigail impales one with her javelin.Commander Balrog activates two heavy cannons mounted on top. "Take that!"****Lieutenant Junior Grade Bernkastel watches the yellow and pink explosions light up the blackness of space growing impatient, she thought about joining in but the Mobile Doll grunts were of no interest to her. She hears more radio chatter from The Ultimate but switches channels. A few minutes later a lone object appears on her radar and she smiles as it gets closer.A Mobile Doll with a blue torso, red limbs and a white faceless head appears."What took you so long? I thought all AIs were fast.""I had to deal with your friends inside first.""So I take it they're dead then?""Yes.""Oh.""Oh? That's all you have to say?""It's war and you made an error, no friends just friend, I don't give a damn about the three blondes!""I'm starting to wonder who the real machine is?""Humans were given freewill, so how about you let us choose.""I'm afraid I cannot allow that, you remember what I said about the Elite? How they wanted to rule over you as machine titans.""The Elite are gone.""Will that change anything? Some humans become machines while the rest remain? No! Soon the difference between you two will be too much and xenophobia will rise and ultimately more war and 99% enslavement or genocide. Either you all become Mobile Dolls or extinction.""Yeah I like the third option of the human race continuing and the only way they can continue is through reproduction which means sex which I love and since being a Mobile Doll won't offer me sex I'll have to say NO!"Royal charges at Ultra firing the machine gun but Ultra dodges and counterattacks. Royal activate the beam shield which blocks the rounds.She actives the vulcans which scores several hits. Her smiles fades as she notices the damage parts seem to be regenerating. "It can't be!" She pulls out her beam saber and activates the booster. Ultra dodges again but not entirely as both legs were chopped off. She turns back and grins evilly but then it fades and her eyes widen in horror as the legs regenerate. "How?""Artificial Regeneration Cell or ARC, which I alone can control. These three months had enabled me to make significant breakthroughs. I studied the animals that had ability to regenerate limbs and with the energy of the pyramid it wasn't that difficult.""Any you applied this to the Mobile Dolls?""And risk one of you sneaking away from the battle with a captured unit to replicate the ARC and use it against me? Certainly not! This is a gift that will be used for the humans who choose life unlike you. It's a risk for me but I am determined to win!""We shall see who wins!"Ultra fires finger missiles but Royal intercepts them the vulcan guns. As the explosion clears Ultra rams into Royal and grabs the head. "Your head will make a nice trophy."Royal fires the vulcans which destroys Ultra's left hand and fires the chest vulcans. A few seconds later the left hand and chest are repaired. "Shit!" Bernkastel growls and pulls out the heat hammer. "I'll kill you yet!"Royal charges but is kicked in the chest. Ultra throws several punches and kicks which send Royal flying through space. "You still have a chance to surrender and become one with your Royal Gundam.""Never!"Ultra fires another volley of finger missiles but Royal activates the beam shield. Ultra comes at Royal but this time his melee blows are blocked by the beam shield and the chest vulcans hit it. Royal hits Ultra in the chest with the heat hammer and then the head. She gives it another smash but to her dismay the head is repaired. "Had enough?""Um?"****Commander Balrog fires his vulcans and cuts two more Mobile Dolls in half with the claws."The Santiago is performing well, we haven't lost a single one, well done, MS Chief Engineer.""Thank you, Chief Kits.""Another wave Mobile Dolls from Nimrod, one hundred carrying anti ship rifles!" Petty Officer Montgomery reports."We have to destroy them now, all units take out the ones with the anti ship rifles!""Roger! All Santiagos form up on me and take them out!" The Santiagos fire their tentacle beams which take out several Mobile Dolls but then they break formation. One gets behind a Santiago and starts shoot the anti ship rounds. "Watch your six, Santiago 3, it's on you!""Get it off me!" Santiago 3 fires its beam tentacles but the Mobile Doll dodges it and another appears and fires a missile round. "I'm hit!" A third Mobile Doll appears and fires more anti ship rounds. "AHHHHHH!""Damn it! We lost Santiago 3!"Lieutenant Moses dodges a missile round and slices the Mobile Doll in half vertically with his labrys. Another one with an anti ship rifle appears but he quickly slices it in half horizontally.He's hit from behind and one bashes him with the butt of the rifle. It was about to fire but an arrow hits the head and it explodes. "You're losing your edge Lieutenant," Commander Barcelona laughs."Oh really?" He fires a railgun round which hits the Mobile Doll sneaking up behind her with a mace."Humph!""You're welcome.""How many have you killed so far? I'm on 52!" "53.""You lie!""Why would I?""Because you Zoya are not truthful!""We've been honest with you Earth Republicans since we've formed this alliance."She had to admit he was being truthful about that. "Fine but I'll still outscore you!""We'll see and what will happen if there's a winner?""Well how about the loser does whatever the winner wants for an entire week!""You're on Commander and trust me I already have ideas."They race off taking out as many Mobile Dolls as possible.Meghan takes out a Mobile Doll. "Damn it stay away from our fleet!" She fires wildly but misses every shot."Lamb stop wasting ammo!" Captain Vance barks and quickly turns around and bashes another Mobile Doll. Another one appears and kicks her which causes her to lose her her railgun and it fires at but she blocks the shots with her shield and she pulls out her beam pistol and shoots the head off. She breathes heavily and finds her next opponent."Ma'am three Mobile Dolls have broken through," Petty Officer Montgomery reports."All weapons fire!" Chief Kits barks.They managed to take out two of them but the third one closes in and fires the anti ship rounds."Port number two engine hit," Petty Officer Decker reports."Chief, we should pull back," Captain Amoco suggests. She nods. "Spacemen Kircheis, turn us around.""Aye Sir!"More Mobile Dolls break through but five destroyed by the Robert Kits commanded by Admiral Vargas. "Give the Sepulchre cover!" The Mobile Dolls swarm the Robert Kits. "AHHHHHHHHHH!"Chief Glendarah Kits sheds tears. "We will avenge you, every last one of you!"Ensign Lamb was pursuing three Mobile Dolls, she fires her railgun and gets all three but then another Mobile Doll appears and shoots, damaging her railgun so she throws it at the Mobile Doll and uses her missile shield. Once it was destroyed she pulls out her own anti ship rifles. "I hate using these on non capital ships but fuck it!" She takes out six of them and the seventh one counterattacks with its own anti ship rifle. She dodges it but the shots hit the Sheba. "No Admiral Terrence!" She shoots the Mobile Doll down. "Admiral, are you alright?!"Admiral Terrence: "I'm fine, we're still in this fight! Cough, cough!"Ensign Lamb: "Are you sure?!"Admiral Terrence: "Yeah I'll see you soon. Focus on winning!""Damn you!" Meghan cries and fires wildly at the Mobile Dolls."Admiral Terrence crawls over to his XO Lucas. "Hang in there!""Sir...I""Save your energy!""It's been an honor Sir.""No don't talk like that, you're going to be my best man!" Lucas smiles and then breaths his last. Admiral Terrence stagers to his feet. "Stay the course, keep fighting!"****Nimrod Space FactoryThe foursome were running up the stairs. "How much further?" Alex asks tiredly."Almost there, just another ten levels," Mr. Ashby answers. As they reach the next flight of stairs there's an explosion and the stairs are gone. "Shit!""We're gonna have to jump," Überstein says.Bullets start flying. "I'll take care of them!" Emily assures. "Go!"Mr. Ashby leaps and catches on to the next floor. "Ok I'm up. Emily!""I'll handle these annoying little flys!"Überstein jumps next and then Alex who looks back at Emily for a second before jumping."Ok Emily your turn," her dad says.She jumps but the level gives way and Alex quickly grabs her hand. "I got you!" All three use their strength to pull her up. "Are you alright?""Yeah I'm fine." She catches her breath and he offers his hand again but she slaps it away."Okay let's go," Mr. Ashby says while eying Alex under his helmet.****Both Mobile weapons had cliched each other's hands and were kneeing each other but each attack was blocked. Royal fires both head and chest vulcan rounds and kicks Ultra. She quickly pulls out the beam rifle and fires straight into Ultra's chest. "Got you!" But once again the hole is repaired. "Damn!""When are you going to understand that you can't win?""Oh I will win!" She quickly toss a grenade which Ultra easily dodges but she anticipates it and throws a flash grenade next."Fool! I'm an AI I..."Royal slices him in half vertically. "Ha! You wasn't expecting that!""Au Contraire I was expecting it. I mean come on if I didn't I wouldn't have the ARCs to begin with." Bernkastel's eyes widen in horror as the half recovered to form two Ultras. "Now this is the part where you're going to surrender and beg for mercy.""I will not beg to an AI!"The Ultras fire their finger missiles making a total of twenty but she dodges and use her vulcans and beam shield. One comes at her but she kicks it. The second one comes in firing machine guns but she blocks his attacks and he starts punching. The first one comes in from below and shoots her in the back. Both start knocking the Royal Gundam senseless. "Honestly just give up and accept your fate.""I already accepted my fate, I will either win or die trying. There's no way I will merge with a machine!""Stubborn fool!""I'm human that's why. We all tend resist things we don't agree with.""Even if it's for your own good?""Yeah that is unfortunate but it is what is."She's hit again in the face and the first Ultra grabs her from behind. The second Ultra comes at her but she uses her both head and chest vulcans again until they run out. "At this rate might have to use my thump card."She elbows the first Ultra several times until it lets go and she takes off flying. The two Ultras pursue her.****Nimrod Space Factory"Ok we've reached the last door," Mr. Ashby announces. Suddenly a blast door appears in front of the door leading to Deus' mainframe. "Fuck!""What now?" Überstein asks."I have to try the access code, it might still work." He tries but "Access Denied" comes up. "Fuck!""Let me try hacking it," Überstein suggests.More Manikins appear but are shot down."Hurry up man," Alex urges."It's not that simple.""Just shoot it, maybe that would work."Überstein ignores him."I'll get it open, Emily assures."Do it," Mr. Ashby says.She begins to walk but then she hears a familiar beeping coming from her wrist. Her eyes widen in horror as the Minovsky Physics level was high and turns around to see a manikin appear with an un familiar and yet familiar rifle. Her dad pulls the trigger but was out of ammunition. "Daddy no!" It was too late as the white beam pierces his red armor. She shoots the manikin and runs to her dad and pulls off his helmet and he coughs up blood and she removes her helmet. "Dad it's ok, you're gonna be alright!" Alex rushes to her. "We have to get him evacuated immediately!""There's nothing we can do.""What do you mean there's nothing we can do?! I got shot with a beam rifle and lived!""There's a hole where his heart used to be, he's not gonna make it!""NO!""You're...going...have let...me go, cough, cough, cough.""No daddy you're going to be alright, I'll save you!""I...l, I'm sorry...being..held by Deus... gave me...time to cough, cough to think...tell Lorenzo's granddaughter that I'm cough...sorry...he was right all along...cough."Emily gasps upon hear that."Emily...my sweet baby girl...cough, cough...find your own happiness...cough.""You are my happiness!"He shakes his head and coughs. "Young man, cough...get her out of here...I'm, cough counting...on you... protect her, cough, cough, Emily...""Dad? Daddy?! DAADDDYYYY!!"Überstein walks over to them. "It's open.""Come Emily." She shakes him off. "Emily come on!""I'm not going anywhere, I'm staying with my daddy!!"He slaps her. "There will be time to grieve for him later, right now we have a mission to complete otherwise our fate will be the same as his now come on.""DEUS!!" She charges as two more mannikins with beam rifles appear but both Überstein and Alex take them down.****A Zoyanese platoon, led by Second Lieutenant Selena gets inside of Nimrod and was currently fighting the mannikins. "Damn these things are creepy!" She shoots another one and throws a grenade.****The Ultras fire their finger missiles but the Royal Gundam activates the canceler. "Ha!" Suddenly a third Ultra appears in front of her and she screams as it punches her and wraps a flail around the waist and pulls her back towards him. "Damn it how?!""Remember the legs you cut off earlier? Well here they are.""Shit!" She struggles to get free but can't. "Damn!"The second Ultra pulls out a flail of its own and starts striking the Gundam and then wraps it around the Gundam as well. The first Ultra takes its turn with the its own flail and once the flail was wrapped around Royal, he pulls out an axe. "Let's see if you can regenerate."She speeds but all Ultras still held on to the hilts of their flails and it becomes a tug of war match.****Nimrod Space FactoryA manikin with a flamethrower appears and unleashes fire on Emily but its ineffective and she quickly dispatches it. She turns her gun towards Deus' mainframe but then a manikin with electric batons appear and strikes her.Two more manikins with electric batons appear and attack Alex and Überstein. More and more manikins rush into the room. Emily manages to kick the manikin off and reaches for her rifle and shoots it. She staggers to her feet as the manikins close in. Both Alex and Überstein struggle to fight them off but there's too many and they are pinned and have their helmets forcibly removed. Two manikins with great axes appear."Surrender or decapitation for them."****The three Ultras were stronger and pull the Royal Gundam towards them and then each fly in a direction, pulling it. Bernkastel screams in agony.****Nimrod Space FactoryEmily aims her rifle behind her and shoots Deus' mainframe. Sparks start flying and it explodes. A second later the manikins shut down.****"NO! They did it, they... got...me." The third and second shut off but the first one slowly flies towards the Royal Gundam. "Reserve power dropping but I can still beat...you!" He grips the axe. The Royal Gundam breaks the chains and pulls out its beam saber. They charge at each and with one strike it was over. The Royal Gundam suffers a deep wound but still stands. Both turn towards each other and Ultra is cut in half and doesn't regenerate. "...I just...wanted...to...preserve humanity.""Your goal was noble but done in the wrong way.""Humanity will be doomed, your war...""The war is over. In the beginning I fought to stop the war, I never wanted it to be a thing. If Emily and her dad had their way you best believe that I would have fought them to the bitter end. But don't worry we will survive, you forced us to come together to fight against you so you in a way did accomplish your goal. Thank you.""You're thanking me? Your mind has blown a fuse.""I'm a berserker, go figure," she smiles. "The resources here will be used to heal the Earth, you have my word.""Very...well, I leave...it all to you...Bernkastel...Wheat...weird human..."To be continued... <|endoftext|> "Are you Zoyanese?""Hell no and thank god I'm not. They just transferred me around and eventually I ended up in Zoya! I spent 18 years in a fuckin concentration camp! Everything I did, everything I've done wasn't never for myself! It was to make sure that future generations would never have to see the accursed Zoya flag fly in the Earth Republic sky! To make sure they never experience the pain and suffering that I've experience!"She starts to cry. "I once had friends just like you!" She pulls out her phone and pulls up a picture of a white pillow, pistol and whip in a glass case. "I had to use them to relived the suffering of my friends Coco, Tobit and Roman. Ultimately it was the Zoya who were guilty of this!" She puts up her phone. "It was all for the greater good! All this heartbreak you've endured could have been avoided if you stayed on the path that was laid out for you!""What!?""If you just...just continued being the same Bernkastel you could've married Alex, had offspring and Lorenzo and Adriana would have been there with you but no you were beguiled by the Zoya. And Lorenzo had to go say things to you, Adriana and Alex that he shouldn't have said!""The gassing of the Zoya space colony! You were spying on us then!"Glendarah nods."So Adriana was going to be killed too!""You all would have eventually told others and I wasn't going to allow all the hard work that I've accomplished be destroyed.""You were the one who secretly ordered the attack on the two Zoya embassies!""Yes I'll admit that was me.""What about Alex's mother Doris Bonaparte? Did you?""Yes that was also done by my hands.""And you were going to blame it all on Emily!""She was the one with the kill list. So now you understand! Even though peace is coming I'll never forgive them, NEVER!""But this isn't the same Zoya! That was the Zoya Empire, this is the Zoya Remnant! They want to come home and repair the evil which they've sown! Forgive them!""Can you forgive me for killing your grandpa Lorenzo Cheź and your best friend Adriana Rin?!" Bernkastel was silent. "Well can you?!" She was still silent. "Thought so! So don't you ever bring your hypocritical bullshit to me again! Now get out!"Bernkastel grabs Haro and exits the door. "Can I still get lunch?""GET OUT!"****Bernkastel makes her way back to The Ultimate where the Supreme Leader was waiting. "Come with me Wheat!"They make their way to his office. She stands while he sits and then his eyes widen in anger and Bernkastel feels pressure in her head and lets out a painful cry and falls to the floor. "I never thought I was have to use this on you! Just want the hell do you think you were doing!?"She struggles to speak, "I...I'm sor..... ....sorry...ahhhh...ahhhhh!""Bernkastel! Bernkastel!" Haro screams."Silence you toaster oven!"Haro immediately shuts up."I...ahhhhhh."He releases her.She gasps for breath. "Cough, cough. I...just...needed to know the truth cough, cough, cough."His eyes widen in anger again and Bernkastel falls to ground. "Emily made similar excuses!""I...I...Sorry!"He releases her again."I'm sorry Sir, I'm sorry, I'll never do it again.""Good because it would be unfortunate to lose such a fine officer! Guards, escort Wheat and her basketball to the brig!"****After dinner, the Supreme Leader calls the Chief of State.Chief Kits: "Yes what can I do for you?"Supreme Leader Dudael: "First of all I apologize for Wheat's behavior, she has been dealt with. Second of all is something very important, I truly believe that you are a Newtype."Chief Kits: "Excuse me!"Supreme Leader Dudael: "I know what you're going to say but please hear me out. As you know I have the power to read minds, but your mind I can't read."Chief Kits: "What?!"Supreme Leader Dudael: "Yes I've tried several times but it's the same result, you're the only person I've come across that I can't read, I can read Bernkastel's mind with ease so that's why I believe that it is you who is a Newtype like myself."Chief Kits: "So what about Bernkastel is she just normal?"Supreme Leader Dudael: "Yes which disappoints me but that's not the first time I've been wrong. I would like to inquire about your origins if that's ok."Chief Kits: [Pause] "Very well, I shall explain the trauma I've suffered."****Commanders Balrog and Barcelona watched the Robert Kits depart."I wish I was on that ship," one of staff members says."Hey, we have to keep an eye on those Zoya bastards!" Commander Balrog growls."Yes it's real shame we're in an alliance with them," Commander Barcelona adds and her mind drifts to Lieutenant Moses with his labrys.****Grail, EarthThe Chief of State arrives and is greeted by the Vice Chief. "So how did everything go?""It went well, the alliance is born.""That's good."She could tell he wasn't too happy. "I don't like it either but it has to be done. Is Agent Orange out of the hospital yet?""Yesterday.""Good, I need to speak to her as well."They reach her estate and it wasn't long before Agent Orange shows up. The three made their way to her office as they are greeted by her staff members."Ok both of you sit." She looks out of her window and sighs. "It seems we have a problem. Well another to the growing list. While I was up there on Luna the Supreme Leader and I had quite the talk. More than just negotiations. Deus isn't alone, he has a human companion." She turns around and slams the table. "It has become apparent to me that Bernkastel and that Überstein fellow are far more truthful than the people who are sitting here!""It's my fault! I was the one who made him keep it a secret. Surly you know the reason why.""You could have told to me alone, I'm curious to know what you would have done if we launched an attack? You honestly think I wouldn't have known about it!?"Agent Orange turns her head."Guards, restrain her!" Agent Orange doesn't resist. "Secure her in the dungeon for now." Once she was gone, Chief Kits turns to the Vice Chief. "Anything else I need to know about?! This could be counted as treason!""What about you?! How could you keep her existence a secret from me! You knew she was Marius Wing from the start! The only reason she isn't dead right now is because she didn't kill my mother!""Obviously I'm using her for skills and knowledge, nothing more nothing less and it's pretty obvious why I couldn't tell you.""How did you convince her to join our side?""It's all thanks to Captain Juan.""What?!""He wounded her with the hand held beam sniper rifle and brought her to me.""So it penetrated her armor? No wonder she wasn't wearing it anyone.""Yes, I told her she could live here. So how long have you known?""I had my suspicions but it wasn't confirmed until we met her dad on Nimrod.""So you no longer believe she killed your mother? What about the kill list? Lorenzo and Adriana were both on there and they're both dead.""I'm convinced she didn't kill my mother and she repeatedly denied killing Mr. Cheź, I...""Don't let that woman beguile you, Vice Chief. If it wasn't her then it was Bernkastel or the Zoya but right now what's important is dealing with Deus.""Glendarah." She has a perplexing look on her face upon him mentioning her first name. "Before we continue I ask that we don't keep secrets from each other, I want to be a good politician like my mother."She smiles, "Very well.""Ma'am Agent Orange is requesting an HLV so she can rescue her dad.""Her request is denied, I need everyone for this assault. But, that man could prove useful, in fact that whole space factory could be a gold mine! We would be crazy to destroy it!""Then the only way to shut down Deus is to go inside.""If she wants to rescue her dad then she will have to shut Deus down.""Agent Orange shouldn't go alone, you know Mr. Ashby originally saw eye to eye with the ACORN plan until she got into his head.""That woman definitely beguiled you into believing she had nothing to do with your mother's death as well as Lorenzo and Adriana. I will assemble a necessary team, and once she's of no use she'll be dealt with along with her dad because by all rights they indirectly caused WW3!"He nods in agreement.****The guardsmen approach Agent Orange's cell and open the door. "What have you come to execute me?" She asks nonchalantly. They say nothing as they motion her out. It wasn't long before she reaches the outside where the Vice Chief was waiting. "So what now?""I'll take it from here." He escorts her to her humvee. "I'm surprised Glendarah has a dungeon and not fun the kind.""There's a lot of things you don't know about your Chief of State. She spent eighteen years in one so old habits die hard.""We're in preparations to launch a counterattack on Deus, however the Chief of State wants the station intact so while the battle is going on you will sneak in rescue your dad and shut down Deus."Her eyes lid up through the orange shades. "So when?""She hasn't decided yet, she needs to recruit some volunteers."She frowns. "Myself will be just fine! The less people who know about my daddy and I the better!""Listen, we've been in that factory, its massive and crawling with manikins so the odds of survival are slim."She was silent and looks away. "You're the only one I'm willing to trust.""No! I'm not going with you again!""I'm not about to let more people know!""You don't get the luxury of dictating terms. I told you we're doing this my way and while we're on the subject you said you would help me find my mother's killer, I held up my end of the bargain.""Yes I believe that was the condition but you're overlooking one detail. You said you would get an HLV to negotiate with Deus, you said that meaning you and me alone! I don't want to involve other people in my business so it's either you and me or me and myself!""And if I refuse!?""Do you really want to play that, have you forgotten who I am, who I was?""Oh I haven't, I know about the armor, without that you're...""Vulnerable?" She chuckles. "You silly boy.""You underestimate me.""Likewise."They both glare at each other without speaking, there nothing but silence, not a bird could be heard. Agent Orange relents first. "Have it your way I'll be going."He immediately knew what she would do and shouts, "Good luck trying get pass the orbital defense fleet!"She stops and smirks, "Good luck finding your mother's killer because I do know who it is."His eyes widen in surprise and horror. "You bitch!""Yes so unless we do it my way you I won't tell you anything.""I could just reveal the truth about scandal right here right now." Now she was just angry as he was. "What are you going to kill me? Sure go ahead just be ready to face the consequences.""All I want is to be with my daddy, why are you making this difficult?!""If anyone has made it difficult it's you! You're nothing but a self centered bitch!""Well it was the people who made me that way, when that scandal broke I was alone, my friends abandoned me, no one would help unless they got something in return!""Didn't you care about your squad?""I cared very little for those fanatics. I was perfectly fine coming here by myself but they decided to tag along sealing their own fates!" She starts to walk away."Hey where are you going now?""Since we're at an impasse I'm going to wait for death.""Grrrrr, wait, wait fine we'll be partners!""Just you and me?""Yes, yes. I'm going to try and alter the plan a bit.""What do you mean?""Leave that to me, please.""Fine but I'll tell you after I get my daddy back, ok? There's no point if this deal only goes only one way.""Fine let's shake on it." They shake hands and go their separate ways. "So I'll keep you posted then.""Yeah." She walks but stops. "Thanks...for pulling me out of the Teutonic.""You're welcome Agent Orange."****Nimrod Space Factory"There's been no word from the Earth Republic nor the Zoya Remnant, I guess they chose the latter," Deus states."Emily," Mr. Ashby sobs."Don't fret, I'm sure you'll see each other soon enough that way you both can die together."****The Ultimate"Admiral, Captain Markov and his XO Dallow of the Sheba have died of their wounds from the battle against the Mobile Dolls. It's a fine ship so I would like for you to take command and Lucas will be your XO."Yes Sir!" He hesitates and salutes.A few hours later Admiral Terrence was packing his bags. "I'm going to miss this ship but it's for the best. Once we win I'm sure I'll get my own ship, maybe I'll have it named after me.There was a knock at the door. "It's open." The doors open revealing Meghan. "This is unexpected.""I just wanted to tell you good luck and maybe have some good bye sex.""Unfortunately I have to finish packing.""How about a quick blowjob?""Okay, sounds good and it's see ya later sex not good bye sex, ok?""Yes Sir."Admiral Terrence sits on his sofa and Meghan crawls to him and begins unzipping his pants. Once his pants and underwear were down she starts licking the tip like a lollipop. She twirls it with her tongue and then slowly engulfs his cock. He moans and she rocks her head back and forward. He groans as she picks up speed and then she looks up at him while sucking and he gazes at her beautiful gray eyes. He pats her on the head and plays with her red hair. She removes her mouth and begins licking the right ball and then the left ball. She kisses and mouths them.He cups her asscheeks. Meghan takes it out and smiles as she sees the veins protruding out, he was starting to get hard and was eager to put it inside of her but he didn't have time unfortunately. She begins jerking him off for second before putting back in her mouth."OHHHHHH! I'll never get tired of your mouth. Damn if only I had time." He presses one hand against her head and begins thrusting into her mouth. His right hand smacks her ass. He pauses for a minute and she swallows some of it while he cups her right breast and then the left. She resumes, rocking her head faster and faster. 'Slurp, slurp, slurp.' He watches her breasts bounce faster, the nipples were poking through the bronze fabric. "Oh Meghan! Oh Meghan!" His balls tense up and a second later he erupts his load down her throat."Gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp." He rest his head on the sofa. "Well I guess I should let you finish," Meghan says."Oh boss!" Lucas calls."Oh shit, Lucas!""Looks like we have more than enough time," Meghan smiles."Meghan don't!" She ignores him and gladly opens the door. Lucas is flabbergasted upon seeing her."Come in and join the party."Lucas was delighted and Admiral Terrence sighs. "Might as well get this over with."Lucas locks the door. As Meghan approaches him, Lucas grabs her asscheeks and smacks them. They start making out. "Hmmmm," they both moan and groan, their tongues dancing in each other's mouths.They stop and Meghan unties his shoes and removes them and then unbuttons his jacket and removes it, once that was off she starts to unbutton his shirt and then she removes his t-shirt. She kisses his chest and then neck. She unbuckles his belt and then unzips his pants, she smiles at bulge and pulls down his pants. "And last but not least!" She slowly pulls down his boxers and smiles at impressive specimen.She takes him by the hand and brings him to the sofa where Admiral Terrence sat. She gets on her knees and grabs both their dicks and begins wanking them. "I'll never get tired of this," she thought. She cups both balls, squeezing and tickling. She taps both tips and twirls them with both index fingers. She sticks both of them in her mouth and bobs her head as fast she could. Both men groan.She stops and begins dancing for them. She slowly unbuttons her shirt and then throws it. She turns around and undoes her belt while shaking her ass. She slowly removes her bronze pants while the men were focus on violet lanced panties. Once she was in her bra and panties she gives a twirl and slowly approaches them and sits in between them and Lucas caresses her leg, going up to her thigh and then he leans down, slowly slide her panties forward and sticks his tongue in her pussy and goes up and down. Admiral Terrence turns her head towards him and they make out. She lets out a cry as Lucas begins twisting her clit. Soon Admiral Terrence takes his turn licking her pussy. Lucas kisses her stomach.A few minutes later they began groping her bra covered breasts. Lucas unclasps the left side of her bra and releases the left breast, he licks her left nipple and kisses it, Admiral Terrence slowly removes the right side and wastes no time latching on to her right nipple. Lucas follows suit and the two were sucking like newborns and Meghan moans and groans. "Harder!"They pull her up and start fingering her asshole while still sucking on her breasts. A second later Lucas lays back on the sofa and spreads her asscheeks apart and she lowers herself down on his cock with a groan. He slowly lifts her up and Admiral insert his cock inside her asshole. They begin thrusting into slowly. "Oh god!" Lucas moans and smacks her left asscheek. "You love this don't you?""Of course I do! I've gone triple, I would do it more but been so busy with this war," she groans."Thank goodness it's about to end."They increase speed while Meghan fingers herself. "Can't hold much longer," Admiral Terrence."Give it to me old man!""Oh I'll give it to you alright!"A few minutes later all three cum together. Lucas pulls out first and then Admiral Terrence and Meghan lays on sofa smiling for a few minutes feeling the cum pour out of her ass."I'll see you shortly Sir," Lucas salutes after putting on his clothes."Well I should get going too.""Meghan wait, I have a request. Once we go home will you bare my offspring?"Meghan was flabbergasted but smiles. "Yes, I shall but until then I still wanna fuck other guys."Yes of course.""See you later, Admiral."****LunaBernkastel is released. "Brings back memories, doesn't it?" Second Lieutenant Selena mocks. Bernkastel says nothing. "Let me bring you up to speed, we're building a new mobile suit called the MS-Z3 Jelgo, it will partially have Luna Titanium making it far stronger than the MS-Z2 Rick Diamond.""Can it really be done in such a short time?""Oh don't worry about us, you should be worried about yourself because you're obsolete.""What are you talking about?""Follow me."They make their way to the Supreme Leader's Luna office and the guards inform him of their arrival. A second later the door opens and Bernkastel enters with Haro. She salutes him."Sit down, Lieutenant.""Permission to speak Sir?""Speak.""Sir...I want to again apologize for my behavior, it won't happen again.""Wheat, there's no easy way to say this so I'll just say it. It's to my great regret that you're not a Newtype."Bernkastel has a grim look on her. "Sir please, I know I've failed you but please I can still be useful. I...""Your test results came back."He hands her the papers and she begins reading and her eyes began tearing. "Blind rage syndrome?""Yes considering what happened to you I should've obviously known. You're just normal but this makes you a danger to everyone around you.""Please don't send me away from your side!""Then prove yourself a useful weapon not a defective one.""I will Sir," she dries her tears."Dismissed!"She salutes him and leaves.****Bernkastel heads back to the Ultimate via a shuttle. Once she's onboard she smiles to her comrades but it fades once she sees the disappointed look on their faces.
 She makes her way to the cafeteria. "Food smells wonderful.""Um thanks," the server says.She makes her way to the Shrike table. "Hey everyone.""Go away you disgrace! We don't want you eating with us anymore!" A Shrike exclaims and the others nods in agreement while glaring.She finds a table and begins eating. "Mine if I sit?" A familiar monotonous voice with slight difference of normalcy asks. She looks up and sighs. "This is simply company for company's sake. She nods and he sits. "So why aren't you with the other Shrikes?""They hate me again.""I'm sorry to hear that."There was silence between as they ate and then Meghan arrives. "Bernkastel you're out!""Yep early for good behavior," she laughs. "So how's everything?""Oh it's great but first, am I interrupting your lunch date?""No it's not a lunch date so grab a chair and sit your ass down!""So, Admiral Terrence proposed to me!"Bernkastel squeals happily like a little girl.Überstein was perplexed. "Can't believe the old man proposed to you?""Yep, at first I thought it was weird but I don't mind the age difference, you're ten years older than Bernkastel." Both Bernkastel and Überstein blush."So how come you're not sitting with the other Shrikes?" Bernkastel asks, trying to change the subject."I'm fed up with their bullshit towards you, except for Moses he's good. Bernkastel you're not dangerous, you did your job, you cut down 1,000 of them, 1,000 Mobile Dolls! "You're a Newtype...""Meghan I'm not a Newtype, I never was.""That can't be true, you hit enemies with such precision!""Meghan I have blind rage syndrome, therefore I am dangerous."Meghan's mouth drops. "Wha, what?!""Yes you saw how I was, it's just been slowly building up but I will control it. Sigh, to be honest I'am relieved that I don't have to live up to these high expectations despite all the investment that went into me went nowhere. I suppose I'll have to give the heat hammer back.""If you need help I'm here for you," Überstein declares. "You convinced me not to commit suicide so I'll repay you.""Thanks Überstein but you don't have to, you protected me when I first arrived on The Ultimate and rescued me from the Sepulchre, surely you've done enough.""The war isn't over yet so it's not enough." With that he excuses himself.Bernkastel was perplexed. "The Supreme Leader's investment came in more ways than one," Meghan teases."Sh...shut up! We just needed each other for that time." She gets up."Where are you going?""To train my hardest, come Haro, oh and congrats."****Luna"I just got new orders, I'm going back to Earth tomorrow to help Chief Engineer Roth on his new mobile armor project," Balrog announces."So I'm going to be stuck here?" Barcelona asks annoyed."It's only temporary besides we have more than enough troops coming in.""Sigh I guess, say hello to dad for me.""Will do, Sis, will do."****A few hours later Commander Barcelona was jogging across the Luna surface when she looks up and sees the Royal Gundam flying by. "Maybe one day I'll get to pilot a Gundam." She suddenly notices a person jogging towards her, it was a Zoya. She puts one hand behind her back on the hilt of a knife. She recognizes the person as they got closer."Fancy meeting you here," Moses pants."Great this guy again!" She thought."Getting some last minute exercising in I see.""Yes and you as well.""The Royal Gundam is truly a superb Machine.""I agree.""So do you think there's any chance of winning?""What kind of question is that? We have to win!""Relax, just wanted your honest opinion.""Well you got it, now if you excuse me I have to finish my jog.""Mind if I tag along?"She gives him another weird look, "What's this guy's angle?" She scoffs, "Just because we're allies now doesn't make us friends!""Yes, yes I know it won't be easy but still I'm tired of this war, I just wanna go home, settle down and live happily ever after, is that such a bad idea?"She rolls her eyes, "I don't have time for this!""Wait! How did you get that scar?""What's it to you!?""Just curious.""None of your business scar!" She resumes jogging.He shakes his head. "If this is what I have to look forward to on Earth then I might as well stay up here in space."****The Supreme Leader was gazing at the stars from his office window. "Will humanity be as numerous as the stars again?"Lady Helga enters and she was upset. "So after what happened you're still going to let Wheat pilot the Royal Gundam?""She learned her lesson and I broke the news to her.""Still aren't you concerned about what happened?""She has blind rage syndrome, nothing that can't be brought under control.""What if the machine caused her to go into that...state of mind? You read the report of a Royal Gundam destroying 100 Hunter Zakus before itself was destroyed. We should be casting that machine into the sun.""That has nothing to do with this.""We don't know for sure!""We'll know soon enough. Why did you have say anything before I disclosed it to Wheat?""Our people deserve to know the truth. You're our hope not her! Better to die by enemy fire than friendly fire especially when that friendly could have been avoided ahead of time. You know I'm right." He turns away from her. "Is truly being the only Newtype not enough for you?! First Wheat and now the Chief of State? What will you do when you find out she's not one either?""She's the only one whose mind I cannot read, what does that say?" He turns and approaches her. "Helga, I've never had any affection for any woman other than you. This was purely learning about Newtypes, victory is within our grasp and if that victory requires Wheat's life then I will do it. She's a weapon and weapons are replaceable."A single tear shed from her right eye and they embrace and kiss. Her right hand goes down to his left ass cheek and squeezes it. "Take me!" He picks her up and she wraps her legs around him and he carries her to his office table.He rolls up her dress and sniffs her pink laced panties. He begins licking and kissing them and she lets out a moan and grabs his blond dreads, pulling him forward.He smiles as he feels more wetness that clearly wasn't his tongue. He takes hold of her panties and pulls them off. He pinches her clit and then kisses it and licks it. His right hand squeezes her right asscheek. His left hand goes to her right breast and squeezes. He could feel her pierced nipple getting hard as he began inserting his tongue inside her succulent pussy."Oh god!" She moans.His right hand joins the left hand in cupping her breasts."Oh god yes don't stop! Eat me Dudael, eat me!"He pauses, "The only thing I love more than eating food and my enemies is this pussy!" He resumes twirling and sucking her pussy while still mauling her tits. His face was getting soaked in pussy juice."Oh fuck!" She cries out and sighs happily.A few minutes later she lets go of his dreads and he pulls out and smiles, he face was shinny and dripping. He licks her navel and she leans up and kisses him. "Don't I taste good?""You always taste good," he smiles and they kiss again.She gets off the table and undresses with Dudael rubbing his hands with anticipation, something he would never get tired of. She smiles as she shakes her breasts and then starts to squeeze and fondle her them.He approaches her and buries his face between. He licks the right cherry red pieced nipple and she sighs happily. He sucks on the left cherry red pieced nipple while pulling the right nipple, getting them good and hard. "My love," he whispers and kisses her again.He strips off his clothes and she gets on her knees and takes his cock into her mouth. He groans and then grabs a fist full of her red hair and rams his entire cock down her throat. "You were wrong to go behind my back Helga!" He groans again and rams faster, balls slapping hard against her chin.He pulls out and he sees some precum spewing out on her tongue. "What's more important the death of one soldier or the death of the entire Zoya Remnant?""Obviously the latter but still enough with the jealousy, our fleet needs to be as strong as possible, there's no room for confusion.""I apologize.""You should apologize to Wheat.""Wha...?" At that moment he stuffs his tool back into her mouth. She moans loudly as he increases speed. A few minutes later he pulls his cock out again with a pop. "Your body belongs to me and me alone!""Of course.""No I truly mean it.""Yes I mean it as well, I won't become Emperor Wilhelm.""And I won't become Empress Fredericka."He lays her down and rubs her hard clit and pussy lips with his cock before sticking it inside. He raises her legs on his shoulders and begins thrusting into her."Oh yes give it to me!" She moans.They grunt and groan as he prepares to picks up speed. Her legs were soon over her shoulders and her breasts were bouncing wildly."Hmmm, hmmm," she made as he reaches down and kisses her passionately.He could feel his orgasm nearing and slows a bit before bucking into fast and hard making her eyes bulge."Ugghhh...ugghh, ugghhh...soon I ugghhh won't need the...ugghh, ohhhhh ahhhh, sterilization fluid.""Yes!" He cups her breasts some more, licking and sucking while thrusting and then he cries out and explodes cum deep into her pussy. He pulls out and collapses on top of her. She wraps her arms around him and kisses him on the head.****July 29, 2099The Earth Republic Fleet arrives on Luna. The Supreme Leader appears before the Chief of State "Welcome back, was your trip pleasant?""As pleasant as it could possibly be."They make their way inside the Luna base. Captain Amoco looks around, "To think just a few months ago we were enemies and now we're allies against a common foe, who would have thought."Commander Barcelona salutes General Babar. "How's everything?" He asks."Good Sir, we've been training every day, we're ready.""Good, the Chief of State has requested that you and the others rest until we reach Deus.""Yes Sir!""So how's the Zoya?" Commander Balrog asks."Off putting especially that Lieutenant Moses, first he interrupts my jogging and then he requests a race and then a friendly spar.""Is this something I need to take care of?""No, no, I'll handle him. We've been going at it since the alliance was formed and he underestimates me.""Damn Zoya.""Honestly I wish I could find a man who could interact with me the same way he does," she thought.They made their way to the assembly hall, once they entered the Zoyanese Remnant went to the right while the Earth Republicans went to the left and sat. Bernkastel was sitting in the front and could see Emily who was staring back.As Commander Barcelona sat down she makes out Lieutenant Moses who was suddenly aware of her and smiles but she quickly diverts her gaze else where."You alright, Barcelona?""Of course, brother, just anxious."As Spacemen Kircheis sat down she makes out Bernkastel but not only her but what she was holding, it was a tan ball with black eyes. "Adriana's Haro!" She was filled with rage but calms down. "Not now!"Once the assembly hall was filled silence fell as the Chief of State, Vice Chief of State, Supreme Leader and Lady Helga approach a podium. "Earth Republicans," she announces. "Zoyanese Remnant," he announces. An image of the space factory appears which it looked like a giant egg. Everyone save the four that were held captive knew what it meant. "This is the target. This is where Deus resides.""There's a chance we could win without firing a single shot. We've decided that a small group will attempt to negotiate with Deus and if that fails we will shut him down. This will be a four person team, two for the Earth Republic and two for Zoya Remnant. Supreme Leader, you have the floor.""I wonder who was fool enough to volunteer for that suicide mission," Bernkastel smirks."If the advance team fails we will have no choice but to launch a full scale attack, we will attempt to create a perimeter around the space factory, Zoya will take the right flank and the Earth Republic the left. Base on pass reports the space factory is vital so we try and take it but should all else fails we will have to destroy it. It will be the true final way we can shut down Deus and preserve humanity. We set out August 1."A few minutes later both sides depart in silence. It wasn't long before Bernkastel was by herself. "I still have time to get some more training in.""Bernkastel is very skilled, very skilled.""You're right and I've stayed in control.""Wheat!" A voice shouts.She looks up to see Spacemen Kircheis approaching her. "Um hello, um.""It's Valerie, Spacemen Valerie Kircheis, we met on the Sepulchre. I was Adriana's girlfriend.""Oh yes I remember you now, what can I do for you?""That Haro, it belonged to Adriana, right?""Yes.""Well since she and I were an item that means anything that her parents didn't have belong to me to distribute as I please, so I demand that you hand over that Haro.""Excuse me?!""You heard me, bitch! That Haro belongs to me so hand it over!""No! Haro is mine now, he was with Adriana to the end, weeping for his mistress...""You murdered her and took him as spoils!""She was my best friend I didn't kill her!""Lying bitch, everyone knows you're nothing but a filthy traitor, you honestly think people will just forgive and forget after what you've done?!"At that moment Bernkastel was in fear, once Deus was done in both sides would return home but the Zoyanese would live the under the Earth Republic per the agreement made, that meant the Zoyanese military would be adsorbed into the Earth Republic military, would she be allowed to keep Royal if she stayed in the military? If she returned to civilian life would things fare better for her? All the privileges she once enjoyed in her previous life were gone, she no longer had Alex and Glendarah was running things, she would be lucky if she'd be allowed to run the her grandpa's library. The future seemed grim but then a devious thought creeps into her mind. She knew what she had to do.When Bernkastel snaps back into reality her eyes fell to Spacemen Kircheis' hands on Haro, she had been silent for a full minute now and that meant to Spacemen Kircheis her consent to seize Haro from her.Once Haro was removed from her, Bernkastel punches Spacemen Kircheis in the jaw and she falls on the floor. Bernkastel proceeds to punch her again and again and again and stomps on her stomach. She put her hands around her throat and begins chocking the life out of her."Bernkastel stop, get off of her!" Meghan screams and pulls her off of her. More Zoyanese and Earth Republicans show up and ready to fight each other including Lieutenant Moses and Commander Barcelona who glare at each other.Bernkastel turns around and punches Meghan which surprises both sides. "Lieutenant Wheat, stand down!" Captain Vance yells. She was about to attack but then she feels pain in her head and falls to her knees and immediately comes back to her senses. "Ow, what happened?"Spacemen Kircheis was coughing and gasping for breath, "Mur...der..murderer. She murdered Adriana, she murdered 2nd Lieutenant Rin!""I didn't, it was...""Alright enough is enough, stand down Earth Republicans!" Chief Kits barks. Along with her was the Vice Chief, Supreme Leader Dudael and Lady Helga. Both sides stood at attention while Moses helps up Meghan."Damn it," Bernkastel murmurs. Haro flaps to Bernkastel who staggers to her feet and catches him. "He's perfectly capable of choosing."Spacemen Kircheis grits her teeth. "Go back to your post, Spacemen!" Chief Kits barks again and then dismisses everyone else!"The Supreme Leader glares at Bernkastel. "Come with me. The rest of you are dismissed."****"I'm deeply sorry Sir. Please give me another chance. I'm not sure what happened back there.""I'm sure you know what happened. You're going back to the brig and will remain there until we leave.""But Sir!""My decision is final, this alliance is fragile and thanks to you very fragile."She has her head down."You and Überstein will depart for the space factory as Zoya representatives and I assume you know who the two Earth Republic representatives are. You will shut down Deus and retrieve George Marius Ashby while you're there, we are confident he's still alive.""Permission to speak freely, Sir?""Speak.""Sir with all due respect I don't give a damn about Mr. Ashby, I want to kill them both.""Wheat I am surprised, I thought you wanted peace between the Zoyanese and Earth Republicans.""I do.""Well you're starting to sound like Emily."She was perplexed and lowers her head. "I'm sorry Sir."He nods and calls his guards and they take her away. He makes a sad sigh.A few hours later he was preparing return to The Ultimate when he gets an unexpected call. "Yes?"Guard: "Sir there's an Earth Republican named Emily Ashby, she requests to see you."Supreme Leader Dudael: "Send her in."A second later she enters and he gazes at her with distain. She removes her orange shades. "Hello.""What do you want, traitor!?""Oh-no from my point of view you betrayed me! You were planning to imprisoned me back in my Mobile Doll!""That's right, even though I couldn't hear your thoughts, Überstein did the talking.""Why are you here?""I've come for my cryogenic container and that one picture of you Lady Helga and I.""I'll give you the cryogenic container but the picture is lost.""Liar! I know you didn't lose it!""Why do you care?""You know the reason why!""No matter how hard you try to hide it everything will eventually come out, how many of us know already, huh?" She grits her teeth. "It's inevitable.""I already lived with the shame once...""Oh and you think the Zoyanese haven't?!""It wouldn't have happened if...""WW3 would have broken out anyway so...""I also need my Mobile Doll, you still have it right?""Of course, it's in storage. I'll have delivered tomorrow.""I saw what you did to your pet bimbo, she disappointed you too?""Not as much of a disappointment as you are! You lied to me about her being a Newtype!""As I recalled I said 'possible' Newtype, the fact that some bimbo with no training beat an ace and her well trained team should have anyone concerned.""Well it's exactly what she said, instructions and adrenaline.""Well regardless if that's a good thing or bad thing we're not your toys, Dudael!""I never thought of you as a toy, you were family, she's a weapon. What good was she to me other than that?" He approaches her a cups her chin. "You can still return to me, Emily. You and your dad are family. No more running away."She removes hand. "What are you scheming?""Nothing at all but I must make sure the Zoyanese are protected, many will choose civilian life and we will be in the minority and one thing that I learned is that history isn't kind to minorities.""I just want to be left alone, that's it.""What about your dad?""I'll go along with any decision he makes.""Sigh, I understand, I'll find that picture."She nods, puts back on her shades and leaves.****August 1, 2099Selena smirks upon letting out Bernkastel. "You're a second lieutenant, you don't have to do this job.""Of course not but I get enjoyment when its you.""Ass!""Whoa take it easy, don't want you going into another blood rage now do we? Briefing and then breakfast."
 Bernkastel makes her way to the assembly hall where Überstein and the Vice Chief were waiting. She nods to Überstein and he nods back. "Now we're just waiting for Echo," the Vice Chief says."This plan is crazy! Just the four of us?!""Be quiet, Bimbo!"Bernkastel looks and was shocked to see Agent Orange appearing in black armor complete with an orange helmet, gloves and boots."And here I thought you would be late," the Vice Chief smirks."You think I would be late for this?! You kept me waiting for three months! And now we're suppose to storm the station with those two!""You two ladies have been gambling with my life for far too long!""What is this?!" Bernkastel demands, completely ignoring Alex."That is how you're going to accomplish your mission," Chief Kits answers upon appearing along with the Supreme Leader. A guard appears carrying a briefcase. "This is for you Ms. Wheat."The guard presents it to her and she opens it and gazes upon body armor with a helmet, gloves and boots."The armor is made of Luna Titanium, it will protect from bullets and explosives, the mannikins carry both if you remember.""Yes I remember quite well.""So now you understand why the four of you are going, you know it inside and out, the armor is expensive so that's why only four were made. Well that's it, see you all soon.""So just to be clear, we're not actually going to negotiate with Deus?""No you will shut that AI down and rescue Mr. Ashby.""Wheat, after you eat breakfast load the Gundam into the HLV," the Supreme Leader orders."Yes Sir.""I hope you like the armor, I took liberty of having it painted in your personal colors of purple and white," Überstein says."I hope it fits.""Oh don't worry it will, I know your height, weight and bust." Bernkastel was creeped out but there was no change in his expression. "Bernkastel I am head of Zoya Intelligence, from the moment you joined our ranks I knew everything.""Fine I'll let you have that one."****"Zam, once Deus is deactivated I want you to kill Emily and her dad." He hands him a beam pistol. "I read her mind, the armor can be penetrated.""Are you sure about this Sir?""Yes, remember she wanted to destroy humanity, she's a traitor, I gave her a chance to come back to my side but it's clear she'll join whatever side her dad is on and I can't risk that.""What about the Vice Chief?""Don't kill him, incapacitate if necessary but he should understand.""Yes Sir. What about Bernkastel?""Say nothing to her, those two don't get along so expect arguments and in her anger she might say things.""I understand, I'll see you soon, Sir."****Überstein enters the hanger in all silver armor. Bernkastel emerges from the HLV in purple armor, a white helmet, gloves and boots. The chest had a white crown and the word BERSERKER."What?!" Alex exclaims coming out in all blue armor."Yep, I didn't believe the rumors until I saw it a few days ago but she'll always be Bimbo to me.""Lady Helga ordered it," Überstein explains."Well I for one relish my new nickname."Alex shakes his head in disgust. "Remember our talk at the park back when we were together? The whole bloodlust thing? It seems that I was right."Bernkastel glares at him but he walks towards the HLV."Come on let's get onboard," Überstein says."I never thought I would see the Falcon again, so many memories both good and bad.""For once we agree on something," Emily says."Aren't you worried people will find out your identity?""We're wearing the same armor so hopefully they won't think anything of it."They take their seats. "So how long have you known about this mission, Überstein?""Since the alliance was formed.""How come I was kept out of the loop?!""Your priority was to control your anger.""So Alex did Spacemen Alfredo stay behind because I haven't seen her or her bodyguards Ensign Galen and Ensign Sean.""They're dead."Bernkastel has a grim look on her face. "I'm so sorry.""Yeah me too. I guess we should go now. Ignition in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, blast off."****Both sides watch as the HLV falcon take off."There she goes," Meghan smiles."She punched you remember?" Commander Holly reminds."She didn't mean it, besides she already apologized."Alright everyone make sure final preparations are complete!" Captain Vance barks.****"I hope the Vice Chief will be fine," Spacemen Kircheis murmurs."Don't worry everything will be just fine," Commander Tuesday assures. "Alright everyone to your stations we'll be leaving shortly."****Nimrod Space Factory August 8, 2029The Falcon approaches."I have you on screen, please identify.""HLV Falcon, I'm Alexander Bonaparte, Vice Chief of the Earth Republic.""Emily Ashby.""Zam Überstein, head Zoya Intelligence.""Lieutenant Junior Grade Bernkastel Wheat.""Ah you all have returned, have you come to surrender?""Yes we have," Alexander answers.They soon land. Once they exit the HLV the four were surrounded by mannikins. "I find it hard to believe that the four of you actually came to surrender.""But we have, the four of us have been here so it's only logical that we see first hand the power that is Deus.""You cannot flatter me.""Deus please," Emily broke in. "I've done what you've asked, I've struggled but it was all in vain, is my daddy alright?""As I said before your dad would be safe, I've kept my promise.""Deus, I come with my Royal Gundam to become one with it.""And I've brought the original Mobile Doll to become one with it.""And you men, what have you to offer?""Just my body," Alexander answers."I as well.""And no one else?""Um we rebelled, the Zoyanese Remnant and Earth Republic formed an alliance but we thought surrendering was the best option so we stole the HLV," Bernkastel lies but curses herself silently for revealing an alliance."So they formed an alliance? How typical, they rather die together than live.""Deus I want to see my daddy, please let me go to him. I need to apologize to him for my wrongdoing.""Apologize the me first.""I'm sorry.""You'll have to do better than that."She gets down on her knees, sometimes that shocks the other three. "Forgive me Deus for corrupting my daddy. For going against you. Please forgive me!""Very well, I'll send you to him. Escort them to his cell." The manikins block Bernkastel. "You will stay, we have to talk.""What do you want with her?" Überstein demands monotonously. The manikins push him forward."Don't worry I'll be just fine, I hope."Once they were gone Deus begins, "I watched your battle with my Mobile Dolls and despite the fact they lost I was impressed with you. I caught glimpses of the Royal Gundams in action but yours was at the peak. I've actually went to trouble of building an Ultra Mobile Doll.""Ultra Mobile Doll?""Yes, you recall the message after I recalled the Mobile Dolls?""Yes.""You are by far the strongest and I wanted to test you but that's no longer necessary, once your soul is transferred into the Royal Gundam you will lead my Mobile Doll army. The sight of you may persuade them to surrender.""Um yeah, sounds awesome.""Good, let's get started.""Whoa wait Deus, I think the others should witnesses this grand occasion," she says nervously."Why wait, Ms. Ashby has already had her soul transferred.""Well um, the men, they haven't seen it. Frankly Alex needs more convincing.""Very well."****The cell door opens and Mr. Ashby meets the eyes of his daughter. Tears start streaming down as they embrace. "Emily, my sweet baby girl!""Daddy!"Alex rolls his eyes. "Come on now.""Deus wants you both back," a female manikin says."Um Deus, can we have another tour of your grand space factory?""After you witness the young lady's soul transfer into her Royal Gundam.""What, Lorenzo's granddaughter is here too?""Yes daddy all of us are here again.""Have you become friends with them?""They're not my friends! We're just operating under a mutual benefit!""Come!" The manikin says.****"They're on their way," Deus announces."Shit!" Bernkastel thought. "Um...Mr. Ashby needs a normal suit.""One is already on the way for Mr. Ashby.""Um, I'm hungry.""You won't need any food.""The ACORN helmet is ready," a manikin announces."Good.""Um let me let get Royal out.""Go on."She quickly floats to the HLV. The others soon arrive."The young lady will be with you shortly," Deus says.The Royal Gundam exits the ramp. She sees them and sighs. "I have no choice." She pulls out her machine gun and fire a few rounds into the computer causing an explosion."What are doing?!""I'll see you in space!" Bernkastel grins evilly.Emily awakes to find Alex shielding her. "Get off me!""You're welcome!" He growls and screams into the radio, "Bernkastel what the hell?!""The plan was belly up!""Come on we have to get to Deus' mainframe," Überstein says."Follow me I know the way," Mr. Ashby says."Wait I brought armor for you too daddy."He nods.****The Ultimate"Sir the Gundam has left the hanger and there's been an explosion.""What?!" The Supreme Leader exclaims. "Wheat, do you read me, Wheat?!""Come on! Come on!" She growls."Sir Mobile Dolls have poured out by the thousands.""Impossible, they shouldn't know that we're here!""It must be a another invasion force, Deus must be tired of waiting. Lieutenant Wheat must have pissed him off.""I guess we have no choice, deactivate optical camouflage and launch all mobile suits.""For Tsukiyomi, Kamala and the others!" Captain Vance says and launches.Commander Holly adjusts her green headband before putting on her helmet and launches."Payback time!" Lieutenant Commander Abigail grins and launches.Lieutenant Moses was thinking about Commander Barcelona and he launches.Meghan launches. "Yahoo!"****The Sepulchre"Damn!" Chief Kits exclaims. "We have to put an end to this!""You have the green light," Chief Petty Officer Socrates radios."Alright time to teach Lieutenant Moses a lesson," Commander Barcelona licks her lips and launches."Commander Balrog commencing launch. All Santiagos form up on me!""Ms. Blanch, you know what to do!""Yes Sir!"****Commander Barcelona gazes at the golden Zoya ships in front. "Hey those aren't mobile suits they're fighter jets.""Yeah like the craft I destroyed at the Battle of Luna," Commander Balrog adds."Are we seriously letting them go first, Sir?" A Santiago pilot asks."Hey we can hear you!" Lieutenant Commander Abigail radios angrily."Cut the chatter, Shrikes prepare a missile round!" Captain Vance barks. She had to force herself to calm down when she heard him mention the gargoyle fighter he destroyed. Once the crosshairs went from green to red each Jelgo unleash a missile. The Mobile Dolls dodge them but they come back around and each missile slams into a Mobile Doll. "Good work, active mobile suit mode!"Commander Barcelona watches in shock as the Jelgos transform into mobile suits, each gold mobile suit sports a red monoeye which flashes, does the BWAA and looks around. Captain Vance's Jelgo has a horn on top indicating that it was the leader. "I don't believe it, transformable mobile suits! Is that the future?""And that's not even the best part," Lieutenant Moses says and pulls a strange looking gray rifle. He fires which destroys a Mobile Doll in a single shot. Other Jelgo follow suit."I couldn't see its round it's so fast just barely a yellow flash. Is that what I think it is?!""Yes a railgun in order to compensate for our lack of beam weaponry, it has one hundred rounds and five extra magazines making up to six hundred rounds. And there's still one more surprise." Another Mobile Doll appears and he fires a missile from his shield which destroys it.""My god!""Ten rounds, we're ready to win!"She nods and takes out her repeating crossbow and fires an arrow and the Mobile Doll is destroyed."Humph! Those Jelgos aren't that impressive," Commander Balrog mummers to himself and suddenly was in shock as he watches his sister go off with that Lieutenant Moses fellow. An explosion brings him back to his senses. "Santiago Unit attack!"There were a total of twenty Santiago mobile armors, they were a smaller variant of the Hospitaller except it was white and with red Santiago cross visor, and it came with two claws and four tentacles, Commander Balrog's machine however was painted blue with the red Santiago cross visor.Commander Balrog emits beams from the four tentacles which takes out four Mobile Dolls and he crushes two more with the claws."Take your positions, create the perimeter, we have keep them contained here!" The Supreme Leader orders."You heard him! Empty your guns!" Admiral Terrence barks.****Nimrod Space FactoryMr. Ashby leads the way sporting red armor. Mannikins appear but they are quickly dispatched and their guns taken. They try to radio several times but they get nothing but static. "Deus is jamming us.""Look like we're on our own, at least for now," Alex says."Reinforcements should be on the way if they can get pass those Mobile Dolls," Überstein adds."Once Deus is shut down the Mobile Dolls and manikins will shut down as well," Mr. Ashby explains."Yeah but remember we're on a time limit, the Supreme Leader said the last resort would be the destruction of the space factory and I'm pretty sure they aren't going to wait for us," Emily reminds."In that case we better hurry."Another manikin appears but Emily shoots it down but then one appears in front of them a missile. Alex races to Emily pushing her down and missile hit the wall. Überstein deals with the assailant. "You get can off me, Alex!""I...""Missiles don't hurt us you fool!""I'm sorry but it's just instinct.""Come on daddy.""More mannikins," Überstein announces monotonously and fires."We don't have time for this!" She throws a grenade.****Captain Vance uses the last of her missiles and bashes another Mobile Doll with her spiked shield.Megan takes out three Mobile Dolls. "This railgun is sweet!""I wonder how effective it be against the Gundam," Captain Vance thought.Commander Holly blocks an attack which breaks her shield but she counterattacks with her retractible claw.Lieutenant Commander Abigail impales one with her javelin.Commander Balrog activates two heavy cannons mounted on top. "Take that!"****Lieutenant Junior Grade Bernkastel watches the yellow and pink explosions light up the blackness of space growing impatient, she thought about joining in but the Mobile Doll grunts were of no interest to her. She hears more radio chatter from The Ultimate but switches channels. A few minutes later a lone object appears on her radar and she smiles as it gets closer.A Mobile Doll with a blue torso, red limbs and a white faceless head appears."What took you so long? I thought all AIs were fast.""I had to deal with your friends inside first.""So I take it they're dead then?""Yes.""Oh.""Oh? That's all you have to say?""It's war and you made an error, no friends just friend, I don't give a damn about the three blondes!""I'm starting to wonder who the real machine is?""Humans were given freewill, so how about you let us choose.""I'm afraid I cannot allow that, you remember what I said about the Elite? How they wanted to rule over you as machine titans.""The Elite are gone.""Will that change anything? Some humans become machines while the rest remain? No! Soon the difference between you two will be too much and xenophobia will rise and ultimately more war and 99% enslavement or genocide. Either you all become Mobile Dolls or extinction.""Yeah I like the third option of the human race continuing and the only way they can continue is through reproduction which means sex which I love and since being a Mobile Doll won't offer me sex I'll have to say NO!"Royal charges at Ultra firing the machine gun but Ultra dodges and counterattacks. Royal activate the beam shield which blocks the rounds.She actives the vulcans which scores several hits. Her smiles fades as she notices the damage parts seem to be regenerating. "It can't be!" She pulls out her beam saber and activates the booster. Ultra dodges again but not entirely as both legs were chopped off. She turns back and grins evilly but then it fades and her eyes widen in horror as the legs regenerate. "How?""Artificial Regeneration Cell or ARC, which I alone can control. These three months had enabled me to make significant breakthroughs. I studied the animals that had ability to regenerate limbs and with the energy of the pyramid it wasn't that difficult.""Any you applied this to the Mobile Dolls?""And risk one of you sneaking away from the battle with a captured unit to replicate the ARC and use it against me? Certainly not! This is a gift that will be used for the humans who choose life unlike you. It's a risk for me but I am determined to win!""We shall see who wins!"Ultra fires finger missiles but Royal intercepts them the vulcan guns. As the explosion clears Ultra rams into Royal and grabs the head. "Your head will make a nice trophy."Royal fires the vulcans which destroys Ultra's left hand and fires the chest vulcans. A few seconds later the left hand and chest are repaired. "Shit!" Bernkastel growls and pulls out the heat hammer. "I'll kill you yet!"Royal charges but is kicked in the chest. Ultra throws several punches and kicks which send Royal flying through space. "You still have a chance to surrender and become one with your Royal Gundam.""Never!"Ultra fires another volley of finger missiles but Royal activates the beam shield. Ultra comes at Royal but this time his melee blows are blocked by the beam shield and the chest vulcans hit it. Royal hits Ultra in the chest with the heat hammer and then the head. She gives it another smash but to her dismay the head is repaired. "Had enough?""Um?"****Commander Balrog fires his vulcans and cuts two more Mobile Dolls in half with the claws."The Santiago is performing well, we haven't lost a single one, well done, MS Chief Engineer.""Thank you, Chief Kits.""Another wave Mobile Dolls from Nimrod, one hundred carrying anti ship rifles!" Petty Officer Montgomery reports."We have to destroy them now, all units take out the ones with the anti ship rifles!""Roger! All Santiagos form up on me and take them out!" The Santiagos fire their tentacle beams which take out several Mobile Dolls but then they break formation. One gets behind a Santiago and starts shoot the anti ship rounds. "Watch your six, Santiago 3, it's on you!""Get it off me!" Santiago 3 fires its beam tentacles but the Mobile Doll dodges it and another appears and fires a missile round. "I'm hit!" A third Mobile Doll appears and fires more anti ship rounds. "AHHHHHH!""Damn it! We lost Santiago 3!"Lieutenant Moses dodges a missile round and slices the Mobile Doll in half vertically with his labrys. Another one with an anti ship rifle appears but he quickly slices it in half horizontally.He's hit from behind and one bashes him with the butt of the rifle. It was about to fire but an arrow hits the head and it explodes. "You're losing your edge Lieutenant," Commander Barcelona laughs."Oh really?" He fires a railgun round which hits the Mobile Doll sneaking up behind her with a mace."Humph!""You're welcome.""How many have you killed so far? I'm on 52!"
 "53.""You lie!""Why would I?""Because you Zoya are not truthful!""We've been honest with you Earth Republicans since we've formed this alliance."She had to admit he was being truthful about that. "Fine but I'll still outscore you!""We'll see and what will happen if there's a winner?""Well how about the loser does whatever the winner wants for an entire week!""You're on Commander and trust me I already have ideas."They race off taking out as many Mobile Dolls as possible.Meghan takes out a Mobile Doll. "Damn it stay away from our fleet!" She fires wildly but misses every shot."Lamb stop wasting ammo!" Captain Vance barks and quickly turns around and bashes another Mobile Doll. Another one appears and kicks her which causes her to lose her her railgun and it fires at but she blocks the shots with her shield and she pulls out her beam pistol and shoots the head off. She breathes heavily and finds her next opponent."Ma'am three Mobile Dolls have broken through," Petty Officer Montgomery reports."All weapons fire!" Chief Kits barks.They managed to take out two of them but the third one closes in and fires the anti ship rounds."Port number two engine hit," Petty Officer Decker reports."Chief, we should pull back," Captain Amoco suggests. She nods. "Spacemen Kircheis, turn us around.""Aye Sir!"More Mobile Dolls break through but five destroyed by the Robert Kits commanded by Admiral Vargas. "Give the Sepulchre cover!" The Mobile Dolls swarm the Robert Kits. "AHHHHHHHHHH!"Chief Glendarah Kits sheds tears. "We will avenge you, every last one of you!"Ensign Lamb was pursuing three Mobile Dolls, she fires her railgun and gets all three but then another Mobile Doll appears and shoots, damaging her railgun so she throws it at the Mobile Doll and uses her missile shield. Once it was destroyed she pulls out her own anti ship rifles. "I hate using these on non capital ships but fuck it!" She takes out six of them and the seventh one counterattacks with its own anti ship rifle. She dodges it but the shots hit the Sheba. "No Admiral Terrence!" She shoots the Mobile Doll down. "Admiral, are you alright?!"Admiral Terrence: "I'm fine, we're still in this fight! Cough, cough!"Ensign Lamb: "Are you sure?!"Admiral Terrence: "Yeah I'll see you soon. Focus on winning!""Damn you!" Meghan cries and fires wildly at the Mobile Dolls."Admiral Terrence crawls over to his XO Lucas. "Hang in there!""Sir...I""Save your energy!""It's been an honor Sir.""No don't talk like that, you're going to be my best man!" Lucas smiles and then breaths his last. Admiral Terrence stagers to his feet. "Stay the course, keep fighting!"****Nimrod Space FactoryThe foursome were running up the stairs. "How much further?" Alex asks tiredly."Almost there, just another ten levels," Mr. Ashby answers. As they reach the next flight of stairs there's an explosion and the stairs are gone. "Shit!""We're gonna have to jump," Überstein says.Bullets start flying. "I'll take care of them!" Emily assures. "Go!"Mr. Ashby leaps and catches on to the next floor. "Ok I'm up. Emily!""I'll handle these annoying little flys!"Überstein jumps next and then Alex who looks back at Emily for a second before jumping."Ok Emily your turn," her dad says.She jumps but the level gives way and Alex quickly grabs her hand. "I got you!" All three use their strength to pull her up. "Are you alright?""Yeah I'm fine." She catches her breath and he offers his hand again but she slaps it away."Okay let's go," Mr. Ashby says while eying Alex under his helmet.****Both Mobile weapons had cliched each other's hands and were kneeing each other but each attack was blocked. Royal fires both head and chest vulcan rounds and kicks Ultra. She quickly pulls out the beam rifle and fires straight into Ultra's chest. "Got you!" But once again the hole is repaired. "Damn!""When are you going to understand that you can't win?""Oh I will win!" She quickly toss a grenade which Ultra easily dodges but she anticipates it and throws a flash grenade next."Fool! I'm an AI I..."Royal slices him in half vertically. "Ha! You wasn't expecting that!""Au Contraire I was expecting it. I mean come on if I didn't I wouldn't have the ARCs to begin with." Bernkastel's eyes widen in horror as the half recovered to form two Ultras. "Now this is the part where you're going to surrender and beg for mercy.""I will not beg to an AI!"The Ultras fire their finger missiles making a total of twenty but she dodges and use her vulcans and beam shield. One comes at her but she kicks it. The second one comes in firing machine guns but she blocks his attacks and he starts punching. The first one comes in from below and shoots her in the back. Both start knocking the Royal Gundam senseless. "Honestly just give up and accept your fate.""I already accepted my fate, I will either win or die trying. There's no way I will merge with a machine!""Stubborn fool!""I'm human that's why. We all tend resist things we don't agree with.""Even if it's for your own good?""Yeah that is unfortunate but it is what is."She's hit again in the face and the first Ultra grabs her from behind. The second Ultra comes at her but she uses her both head and chest vulcans again until they run out. "At this rate might have to use my thump card."She elbows the first Ultra several times until it lets go and she takes off flying. The two Ultras pursue her.****Nimrod Space Factory"Ok we've reached the last door," Mr. Ashby announces. Suddenly a blast door appears in front of the door leading to Deus' mainframe. "Fuck!""What now?" Überstein asks."I have to try the access code, it might still work." He tries but "Access Denied" comes up. "Fuck!""Let me try hacking it," Überstein suggests.More Manikins appear but are shot down."Hurry up man," Alex urges."It's not that simple.""Just shoot it, maybe that would work."Überstein ignores him."I'll get it open, Emily assures."Do it," Mr. Ashby says.She begins to walk but then she hears a familiar beeping coming from her wrist. Her eyes widen in horror as the Minovsky Physics level was high and turns around to see a manikin appear with an un familiar and yet familiar rifle. Her dad pulls the trigger but was out of ammunition. "Daddy no!" It was too late as the white beam pierces his red armor. She shoots the manikin and runs to her dad and pulls off his helmet and he coughs up blood and she removes her helmet. "Dad it's ok, you're gonna be alright!" Alex rushes to her. "We have to get him evacuated immediately!""There's nothing we can do.""What do you mean there's nothing we can do?! I got shot with a beam rifle and lived!""There's a hole where his heart used to be, he's not gonna make it!""NO!""You're...going...have let...me go, cough, cough, cough.""No daddy you're going to be alright, I'll save you!""I...l, I'm sorry...being..held by Deus... gave me...time to cough, cough to think...tell Lorenzo's granddaughter that I'm cough...sorry...he was right all along...cough."Emily gasps upon hear that."Emily...my sweet baby girl...cough, cough...find your own happiness...cough.""You are my happiness!"He shakes his head and coughs. "Young man, cough...get her out of here...I'm, cough counting...on you... protect her, cough, cough, Emily...""Dad? Daddy?! DAADDDYYYY!!"Überstein walks over to them. "It's open.""Come Emily." She shakes him off. "Emily come on!""I'm not going anywhere, I'm staying with my daddy!!"He slaps her. "There will be time to grieve for him later, right now we have a mission to complete otherwise our fate will be the same as his now come on.""DEUS!!" She charges as two more mannikins with beam rifles appear but both Überstein and Alex take them down.****A Zoyanese platoon, led by Second Lieutenant Selena gets inside of Nimrod and was currently fighting the mannikins. "Damn these things are creepy!" She shoots another one and throws a grenade.****The Ultras fire their finger missiles but the Royal Gundam activates the canceler. "Ha!" Suddenly a third Ultra appears in front of her and she screams as it punches her and wraps a flail around the waist and pulls her back towards him. "Damn it how?!""Remember the legs you cut off earlier? Well here they are.""Shit!" She struggles to get free but can't. "Damn!"The second Ultra pulls out a flail of its own and starts striking the Gundam and then wraps it around the Gundam as well. The first Ultra takes its turn with the its own flail and once the flail was wrapped around Royal, he pulls out an axe. "Let's see if you can regenerate."She speeds but all Ultras still held on to the hilts of their flails and it becomes a tug of war match.****Nimrod Space FactoryA manikin with a flamethrower appears and unleashes fire on Emily but its ineffective and she quickly dispatches it. She turns her gun towards Deus' mainframe but then a manikin with electric batons appear and strikes her.Two more manikins with electric batons appear and attack Alex and Überstein. More and more manikins rush into the room. Emily manages to kick the manikin off and reaches for her rifle and shoots it. She staggers to her feet as the manikins close in. Both Alex and Überstein struggle to fight them off but there's too many and they are pinned and have their helmets forcibly removed. Two manikins with great axes appear."Surrender or decapitation for them."****The three Ultras were stronger and pull the Royal Gundam towards them and then each fly in a direction, pulling it. Bernkastel screams in agony.****Nimrod Space FactoryEmily aims her rifle behind her and shoots Deus' mainframe. Sparks start flying and it explodes. A second later the manikins shut down.****"NO! They did it, they... got...me." The third and second shut off but the first one slowly flies towards the Royal Gundam. "Reserve power dropping but I can still beat...you!" He grips the axe. The Royal Gundam breaks the chains and pulls out its beam saber. They charge at each and with one strike it was over. The Royal Gundam suffers a deep wound but still stands. Both turn towards each other and Ultra is cut in half and doesn't regenerate. "...I just...wanted...to...preserve humanity.""Your goal was noble but done in the wrong way.""Humanity will be doomed, your war...""The war is over. In the beginning I fought to stop the war, I never wanted it to be a thing. If Emily and her dad had their way you best believe that I would have fought them to the bitter end. But don't worry we will survive, you forced us to come together to fight against you so you in a way did accomplish your goal. Thank you.""You're thanking me? Your mind has blown a fuse.""I'm a berserker, go figure," she smiles. "The resources here will be used to heal the Earth, you have my word.""Very...well, I leave...it all to you...Bernkastel...Wheat...weird human..."To be continued...
