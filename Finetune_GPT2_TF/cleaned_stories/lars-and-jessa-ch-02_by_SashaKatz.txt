For those unfamiliar with the first installment, the stories are probably best read in order. Thank you for taking the time to read.* * * * * * * * * * *CHAPTER 1Roseanne and I were astonished when Violet told us that she'd never been properly fucked before. The three of us were having a quiet cigarette on the benches outside school and Violet was reflecting on her latest breakup."I mean, I've had a lot of sex that was good, you know? But nothing that was just, like, mind blowing. At least I don't think I have." Violet took a drag of her cigarette while Rosanne and I shot each other a glance."If you're not sure, then you probably haven't," said Roseanne."Yeah, you're right," said Violet. I didn't say anything because I was still pondering the implications of this.Violet's a good friend but it can be challenging to hang around with her. When the three of us walk down the street, every guy is looking at Violet, and only at Violet. She's all curves, practically every contour of her body is an exaggeration of the female form. She's got a big round ass but it's proportionately perfect; I've seen her literally stop traffic with it. Her hair is long and lustrous, red-tinted with copper highlights. She has luminous emerald-green eyes that will stop you dead in your tracks, even if you've known her for years.Men don't stand a chance; they're drawn to Violet like moths to a flame. They flutter around her, laugh at her jokes, and are endlessly fascinated by everything she does. They pay just the minimal amount of attention to me and Roseanne to avoid seeming like total assholes. Am I a little jealous? Of course I am. But Violet is a sweetheart, and it's not really her fault that every guy wants to fuck her. I imagine that gets exhausting, after a while.All of this is to say that, to look at Violet, you would just assume that she's having great sex all the time. There's seemingly nothing stopping her from getting it whenever she wants, however she wants, from whomever she wants. So hearing her complaint was particularly disturbing -- if Violet can't get a proper fuck, then what hope is there for everyone else?"It's not just you," said Roseanne. "For me it's always been . . . adequate. Nothing earth-shattering." Roseanne was lying, of course, but she would never actually admit that some guy had rocked her world."Am I expecting too much or am I just meeting the wrong guys?" Violet asked. Neither of us responded. "What about you?" she asked me. I stared down at the ash forming on my cigarette, wishing I could avoid this conversation. Roseanne laughed derisively."Oh, Jessa's mind has been blown," she said.Violet's eyes lit up. "Details!" she demanded. "When did this happen?" I shot Roseanne a dirty look."Recently. Maybe a week ago," I said, reluctantly."Someone at school?""Yeah.""Can you tell me who? I shook my head. "Pretty please?" she pleaded, irresistibly, thick eyelashes fluttering."Just tell her," said Roseanne. "What difference does it make?" We all knew Violet would get it out of me eventually, it was useless to resist her."Lars Parsons," I said at last. Violet looked shocked and incredulous, like I'd just told her the aliens had landed."Oh my God!" She turned to Roseanne. "You knew about this?""Apparently he fucked Jessa so good she passed out," said Roseanne."Just for a moment," I said."For real? Lars?" Violet stared at me, glassy-eyed. Her voice lowered to a whisper. "I had no idea. Is he seriously packing, or what?""That wasn't it. It was more like, I dunno. We fit together the right way, I guess.""Jessa thinks she had a near-death experience," said Roseanne, sniffing and blowing out a giant cloud of smoke."I'm pretty sure I did," I said.Violet looked perplexed and slightly horrified. "You almost died?""No. It's hard to explain. Like an orgasm so intense that it seems like dying."I had Violet's complete and total attention now. "How so?" she asked."You come so hard that it becomes your entire existence. Everything else is just snuffed out. Darkness, nothing there anymore." Roseanne rolled her eyes and flicked her cigarette butt into the street in an impressive shower of sparks."That's wicked," said Violet, emerald eyes alight. "I can't even imagine what that would feel like." She pondered it for a moment. "You think it could happen again?""I have no idea. I doubt it.""You know, it's funny, I used to have this silly little crush on Lars," Violet said, "if I'd known he was some kind of sex god.""I'm not sure he is," I said. "I don't really know how it happened.""Give the guy a little credit," said Roseanne."So are you two seeing each other?" Violet asked."No, not at all," I replied."You're funny," said Violet, "I'd sure as shit be seeing him after that."CHAPTER 2It feels strange to be sitting at home on Saturday night but Roseanne's home with the flu and Violet's out breaking hearts somewhere. It's a cold, rainy night and the TV couch is warm and inviting. Mom's in her room napping before her shift at the hospital, so I crouch outside on the fire escape in the rain and smoke the stale, wrinkly joint that I found in my army jacket yesterday. I have to hunch against the building to light the damn thing and keep the rain from putting it out.I hardly ever smoke pot anymore, but I'm bored and it will pass the time very nicely. I hit it a couple of times and cough violently into my sleeve. I'm soon cold and wet, my legs are cramping up and there's no way I'm finishing this thing tonight, so I stub it out gently against the damp wall behind me. High as a kite, I stagger back through the window into the warm living room and collapse onto the couch, burrowing under a wool blanket.I flip on the TV. There's some outer space documentary on the Discovery Channel. The spiral arms of the Milky Way are slowly rotating. At the center of the galaxy lies a supermassive black hole, dense and dark, with gravity so strong that not even light can escape. On the screen the black hole voraciously swallows innocent nearby stars into its infinite, absolute darkness; the entire galaxy is caught in its pull, madly spinning around it."Black hole" makes it sound so cute and friendly, but really, it's the utter absence of light. Nothingness. The void. I stare at the screen, my eyes barely open, imagining what it would feel like to be sucked in there. My earlier conversation with Violet replays in my mind, I wonder if she ever watches shows like this. It seems unlikely. But I bet Lars does.I feel a tingle and flutter between my thighs. I'm thinking about the black hole and then I'm remembering Lars writhing beneath me, his cock plunging into me again and again, my body shaking and hips thrusting desperately to meet him. Reaching into my sweatpants, I discover that my panties are already soaked. Beneath, my pussy is slick and sopping, radiating warmth and arousal.I rub my clit deftly and gently, just the lightest touch of my fingertips. The sensations echo around my drug-addled mind like a feedback loop, growing in intensity. My fingers begin to work faster and suddenly an image of Violet flashes through my mind; naked and slick with sweat, her hair disheveled, nipples stiff and swollen, head thrown back and mouth wrenched wide in a silent scream, consumed by an orgasm that shakes the foundation of her very existence.My fingers are moving quickly and precisely now, applying delicate but insistent pressure on my clitoris that forces me to gasp and shudder, my body drawn taut like elastic. On the TV they're talking about dark matter, the nearly infinite black space between the stars. The image of Violet fades as my mind goes slowly dark, subsumed by a recurring wave of bliss that rises within me until I can barely stand its intensity, and then recedes, leaving my body clenched and quivering in anticipation of its return. As the waves wash over me, my consciousness fades away, there exists only pure, exquisite sensation.For one fleeting second, I'm back in that bedroom with Lars, riding the wave as it starts to crash down into darkness, the abyss opening before me.Then suddenly the moment is gone, and it's just me, writhing under a blanket on my mom's couch, stoned out of my mind while the room spins around me and the TV flickers in the dark. I pull my hand out of my pants and catch my breath.Roseanne called it the "existential orgasm." She thinks I'm making the whole thing up, but just now, for a one brief moment, I had glimpsed it again. All it had taken was a rainy night at home and, of all things, a Discovery Channel documentary. Was I going a little crazy? It was possible. But I knew that what I wanted -- what I needed -- was to get myself back there again.CHAPTER 3I scheduled the DVR to record every space documentary on cable, to the point where the memory was entirely filled up and Mom couldn't record Grey's Anatomy. "Since when are you so interested in all these space shows," she asked me.But when I watched them, I wasn't getting turned on at all, plus I started to feel like a total head case lying there fingering myself to images of black holes and dry lectures about the event horizon. Apparently, I had managed to catch lightning in a bottle before. Whatever stars had aligned then, they sure as hell weren't aligning now.Having no further success in recapturing the "existential orgasm" through my solo efforts, I decided to enlist the help of a capable outside party. For some time, my friend Grace had been trying to hook me up with Archer, her boyfriend's ex-roommate, who had graduated from Northeastern and worked as a fitness trainer. Reportedly, he was 6'5" of solid muscle, with a huge cock and a fearsome reputation in the bedroom."He'll change your life, sweetie," promised Grace, who undoubtably still took the occasional tumble when her boyfriend wasn't looking.Archer seemed like the right man for this particular job.I met him at a Greek restaurant just off Porter Square. He was blonde, lantern-jawed and carried himself with a swagger that I found immediately irritating. His idea of an icebreaker was to tell me I looked like Selma Blair and then launch into a dissertation about how hot she was. After ten more minutes discussing his career as both fitness trainer and "life coach," it was clear he wasn't the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree, but that didn't really matter.Archer didn't care much about impressing me, and he made no effort to avoid staring at my breasts or to refrain from indulging in a steady stream of sexual innuendo. I forced myself to laugh at a few of his jokes, and I didn't stop him from paying for dinner. I usually avoid dating like the plague but this wasn't a date, more like a blind booty call. We both knew where things were headed, so the pressure was off and we could be ourselves, for better or for worse.It didn't take long for us to get back to his place, an apartment just off Harvard Square that was probably the height of luxury about fifteen years ago but had since fallen on hard times. We drank some wine and made out on his couch. He was what Roseanne calls a tongue-wrestler, and his breath reeked of lamb and tzatziki. He asked what I wanted to do next and I played coy for a while and then told him that I wanted him to fuck me so good that I blacked out.Archer was impressed. "You're a little freak, huh?" he said. I was going to try to explain further, but then he stood up and began taking off his clothes. He undressed slowly and deliberately, flexing his deeply etched abdominals as he pulled off his shirt. Despite his other shortcomings, he was easily the most impressive physical specimen I had ever encountered, and I stared, mesmerized, as he unbuckled his belt and slid his pants down slowly to reveal his powerful, muscular thighs and the undeniably large bulge in his briefs. I could feel a dull, hungry ache in my clit and a pleasant warmth spreading between my legs. Now fully naked, except for a tiny pair of briefs, he walked to where I sat on the couch.I had to touch him, run my hands over the massive, rigid muscles in his thighs and stomach, as the bulge in his briefs twitched and expanded. When I lowered the briefs, his cock fell heavily out, long and thick, even in its semi-hard state. I gazed hungrily, estimating it was nearly as big as Led Zeppelin II, the hardworking electric blue dildo I keep hidden under my bed (its predecessor, Led Zeppelin I, had long since departed for Valhalla after a lifetime of dutiful service).Archer then managed to ruin the moment, making a show of waving his big dick in my face and then trying to guide himself straight into my mouth. There was no way I was letting him jam that thing down my throat. Instead, I stroked him off enthusiastically with both hands, until his cock was rigid and leaking in my grasp. Fully erect and horny as a bull moose, Archer lifted me up effortlessly and carried me into the bedroom, where he literally tossed me onto the bed and yanked off my skirt and my underwear in one swift motion. I would have been impressed if I hadn't been so surprised to suddenly find myself lying half-naked and spread-eagled on the bed.He grinned at me as I lay sprawled beneath him, pulling off my shirt. "You ready to get fucked?" he asked, spreading my legs and tweaking my clit with his fingers. Suddenly, his cock was lying, warm and heavy, against my thigh and then he was sliding it slowly over my slick, soaked labia and across my clit, relentlessly back and forth. It was not long before he had me quivering helplessly in anticipation, grinding myself against the mattress like an animal in heat, my pussy nearly molten with need."Tell me how much you want it," he whispered. I wanted it so fucking bad but he was playing games with me, and I was not about to give him the upper hand. I opened my mouth intending to deliver a sharp comeback, but then his cock dragged across my clit again and all that came out was a low whine."I can't hear you," he sang. He stopped moving and nothing happened for a long time as I lay there, my body clenched and shaking like an overwound clock spring, and I was right on the verge of breaking down and just begging and pleading with him to fuck me. Then I felt his cock slide into me, and I gasped with relief as it sank deep, completely filling me. I lay quivering and moaning, fully impaled on his huge shaft as he worked it slowly around inside me and then pulled out. Before I could collect my thoughts, his cock sank into me the second time.Led Zeppelins I & II had somewhat prepared me for this moment but it was a very different experience with Archer's huge muscular frame pinning me to the bed and the powerful and unyielding force of his hips thrusting into me. I was breathing heavily now, eyes half-lidded and my hands reflexively clutching my breasts. Every stroke was intense but deeply satisfying, my pussy twitching convulsively in anticipation of each new thrust."That's right, just take it," whispered Archer, his hips thrusting smoothly and effortlessly into me. His huge hands grasped my waist as I thrust my hips against him, guiding his cock deep to sweet sensitive places that desperately needed its attention. I thought I might be on my way, but then I looked up to see his big goofy mug grinning down at me."You like that, don't you?" he grunted. "Taking that big dick like a champ.""Just shut up and fuck me," I snapped.He grasped me tightly with his massive arms and began fucking me in double time, our bodies slapping loudly together in a frenetic rhythm. He was filling me to the absolute limit, his cock thrusting nearly continuously across each and every sensitive area inside me, lighting me up like a pinball machine. Now I was crying out in time with his thrusts, eyes dropped out of focus, my body convulsing with the intense and exquisite pleasure he was wringing out of me. He had me now, and he knew it. It felt so fucking good to be held down and pounded and I knew I would do absolutely anything he wanted if he would just keep fucking me like this for a while longer, just a little while longer.And then my thoughts began to drain away, diluted and swept aside by a rising tide of pure blissful sensation. My mind dimmed, darkness appearing at the edges, like the arrival of forest twilight, and then I knew it was happening, what I'd been waiting for, and I clutched Archer and told him that I needed him to just keep fucking me like this, a little longer. It was so close now.In response, he sat up straight and bellowed, gripping me painfully tight and slamming himself into me faster and faster until his hips were just a blur and he was roughly jackhammering me into the mattress underneath. Everything had changed. The intensity was overwhelming, the orgasmic bliss of just a moment ago replaced by the sheer force of his cock continuously battering my sensitive insides as his body slammed against mine.A transcendent fucking had suddenly become a dangerous amusement park ride where all I could do was hold on for dear life and pray for it to end. I opened my eyes to see his face hovering above me, now beet red, his jaw clenched and eyes staring vacantly into the distance. I lay there for several moments getting pounded into the bed, suddenly scared by the thought that even if I asked him to stop, there was no guarantee that he actually would, and there would be absolutely nothing I could do about it.Suddenly, mercifully, he sat bolt upright and bellowed at the top of his lungs as he pulled his cock out of me and blew his load all over my stomach. He stood up and, without a word, walked out of the bedroom, leaving me lying there clutching my poor pussy, unable to even sit up but thanking my lucky stars that he hadn't lasted any longer. He reappeared a few minutes later with a wet towel which I used to clean myself off. I hastily located my underwear and pulled it on while he lay back on the bed, admiring his own deflating erection."I'm impressed," he said at last. "You can really take it." This was clearly as much pillow talk as he was offering. "A lot of girls can't," he continued, "They're just not built for it."I ignored him and disappeared hastily into the bathroom. Looking into the mirror was a grim reality check. My hair was a mess, my cheeks flushed and my belly was still sticky. Realizing my nipples were still stiff and swollen, I hastily pulled on my shirt. All I wanted to do was go home and sit in a hot bath."So how was it?" he asked when I came out of the bathroom."Pretty intense," I said."You come?""No.""Hard to believe. You were in the zone for sure.""It didn't happen."I told him I had to leave. He insisted that I have one more drink for the road, which I accepted only because, frankly, I needed one."Most girls like to go a second round, at least," he informed me, pouring two glasses of red wine."Not this girl.""You're an intense chick," he observed, handing me a glass. "I wish you'd stick around, we could have some fun. Where you go to school again?"Cambridge Rindge & Latin. High school.""Fuck! You're kidding.""I turned eighteen a few months ago.""Yeah, no -- it's just -- surprising!" he exclaimed. "Grace must've forgotten to tell me that part." I took a slow sip of the wine and he watched me with an unsettling sort of predatory interest."So I'm curious," he asked, "what does a guy have to do to get you off?" I gulped down the rest of the wine and held the glass out to him. He refilled it, waiting for my response. "For a start, just pounding me as fast as you can isn't going to do it.""I don't get many complaints.""Most girls don't know any better."He chuckled indignantly at me. "But you clearly do. So what would you suggest?""Maybe try understanding what a girl responds to, what's working for her.""I'd say it worked pretty well for you," he replied. He was just baiting me now, and it was making me angry."You asked for my advice and I gave it to you. I'm sure you think you gave me the fuck of a lifetime but honestly, all I'm going to remember about tonight is how sore I was the next day."He stared at me blankly for a moment and then leaned back and laughed. "I doubt that very much," he said."And that took like what -- five minutes? If I'm being generous?""You're the one who wants to leave," he said, patting the bulge in his sweatpants. "I'm here all night.""Yeah, no thanks." I stood up and headed for the door. I wasn't going to give him the satisfaction of provoking me into a rage. He stood up, blocking my way."We should see each other again," he said. "Second time's a charm.""I really don't think so.""Because you know it's true.""You had your shot.""Just think about it," he said, moving aside to let me pass. "You'll be back here soon enough and we can have some real fun." I brushed past him and out the front door without another word. Before closing the door, I turned back for a second."Oh, and work on the dirty talk," I said. "It's fucking corny."CHAPTER 4Mom has tonight off so we're having mother-daughter night which traditionally consists of Chinese food, followed by a movie which Mom always chooses, and which is always from before 1980. Since we both share a love of spicy food, our go-to for Chinese is Szechuan Mountain House. Mom is partial to Ma-Po Tofu and I order Dan Dan Noodles and a pile of spicy pickled veggies.On mother-daughter night, Mom always asks me if there are any special guys right now. Invariably, the answer is no. I tell her I have no interest in seeing anyone."You've said that before," she says, "but I've never understood why. Did you get tired of boys?""Not all of them. I just don't want to, you know, date them.""Dating just means you spend some time with someone, see if there's a connection.""I don't need to date anyone to be in a relationship," I tell her. "I can get to know them naturally, you know -- organically.""Organically?""Just hanging out with a guy, on my own terms. No bullshit. No obligation. If it happens, it happens.""And the guys are fine with this?" she asks."I mean, they don't have much choice.""Okay," she says, "so let me ask my question differently. Are there any guys you like just hanging out with, on your own terms?"Yeah, mom, I think to myself, I met this swell guy Archer last night, what a sweetheart, let me tell you. Hung like a horse, and you know, the reason I spent all day on the couch was because he railed me so hard that I was too fucking sore to walk.What I actually say is: "Not really."I think about it for a moment. "I hung out with this guy Lars from school last week, he helped me with a paper.""Tell me about Lars," she says."I dunno. Not much to say really. He's kind of shy and bookish but he's a nice guy, not some asshole.""Is he cute?""Yeah, fine, mom, he's cute. Happy now?"You going to spend time with him again?""I doubt it.""Well, whatever happens, try to be nice to him," she says. And like that, the discussion is over and then we're clearing the take-out containers and putting the leftovers in the fridge.Once dinner is cleaned up, we retire to the couch. Tonight's movie is "Bringing Up Baby," which has an off-putting title, but it turns out "Baby" is really a disobedient pet leopard and it stars Cary Grant as the world's most dashing palaeontologist. The ritual demands that after the movie is over, we discuss it over a pint of Ben & Jerry's."I liked it," says Mom. "I didn't know Katherine Hepburn could be so funny.""What bothers me is that the character's just a male fantasy. The quirky mystery woman who magically appears to show the stuffy scientist what he's been missing his whole life.""Well, it was made eighty years ago," Mom says."It happens in movies all the time.""I suppose.""And now there's all these guys convinced that they need some unpredictable, free-spirited girl to show them the way.""You meet a lot of these guys?" she asks."Yeah. Some."Mom is yawning and it's not long before she heads to bed. Once her light is out, I dig what's left of that joint out of my desk drawer and head up to the roof of our building.It's a cloudy night and no stars can be seen. I light the joint and take the smoke deep into my lungs. I wish I hadn't brought Lars up at dinner, but he's been on my mind lately. It's been nine days since he was over here and I've very obviously been avoiding him at school. Boys can get so attached the moment you show them any interest, so I've found it's best to set boundaries. On the other hand, I can't just keep avoiding him, it's not practical. And, in fairness, Lars isn't just any boy. Somehow it feels like we've been through a lot together even though it was really just a single night. I'm starting to feel bad about blowing him off. If nothing else, I owe him an explanation.Mom thinks I'm afraid to be in a relationship, but I'm not interested in her outdated definition of what a relationship is supposed to be. It's not some guy and girl sharing a milkshake like a fucking Norman Rockwell painting. It's however I choose to connect with someone, no one's telling me how I have to do it.I must be high as fuck. There's some leftover Dan Dan Noodles in the fridge and that's where I'm headed next.CHAPTER 5The next day after school, Lars is waiting outside the entrance. He's clearly waiting for me, because no one else is around. It took me thirty minutes after school ended to find the damn art history book I need in in the library, and apparently Lars has been waiting patiently here the whole time."Hey, Lars," I call out.'How are you?" he asks. "I've haven't seen you all week.""Yeah, I'm sorry -- I know I've been kind of distant.""Well—me too, I guess."I'm standing next to him now, practically kissing distance. He looks nervous, like he's afraid of what I'm going to say next."Listen, Lars, I had a good time with you.""Yeah, me too. Absolutely." We're both quiet for a moment."It was kind of a strange night, don't you think?"He thinks about it for a moment. "You know it was my first time, right?""Yeah, I knew.""That obvious, huh?""No, it's just that -- girls usually know.""It was different from how I'd imagined it. Not in a bad way though.""Different can be good," I say, trying to force a smile but not really feeling it."So what happens now?" he asks."I don't know. What do you think?"He hesitates for a moment. "I guess I was hoping I could see you again.""Look, I need to be honest with you," I say, "I don't really ever date anyone. It's just not my thing.""We don't have to date," he says. "We could just hang out, or whatever.""I don't think it's going to work," I say. "It's complicated, Lars—I'm sorry. I'm not trying to tell you to get lost, I'm really not. It's just you—you should make other plans, you know?""I don't have other plans," he replies, staring down at his feet. I can tell he's hurt and angry. I've been in this situation before, and I've always just told myself that I didn't owe it to any of these guys to see them if I wasn't feeling it. But this time, it's hard to justify exactly why I'm treating Lars this way. I'm hurting him for reasons that don't really make sense to me anymore.The silence is excruciating, I need to say something, I can't just blow him off and I really want to try to make him understand."It's got nothing to do with you. It's me -- I can't -- I'm just not able to . . . be anybody's girlfriend.""Yeah, okay. I get it." He jams his hands into his pockets, turns and walks away. I want to call after him but I don't know what more to say and I'll probably only make things worse.CHAPTER 6My fears had now been officially confirmed. I was just a dumb inexperienced guy who got himself all tied up in knots over nothing. I had simply misread the situation. Made a huge deal out of something that was clearly routine for Jessa. I beat myself up afterward for not explaining more thoroughly how I felt, but really there was nothing I could have said that would have made any difference. The truth was, I liked her a lot. She was sensitive and smart, and her sexual confidence and assertiveness really turned me on. She seemed lonely, and I wanted to be someone that could make her feel like she was needed and loved.But it was not to be. I thought we had made a connection, but it was now clear that she had viewed me as a conquest, and having succeeded, she'd moved on. I didn't really understand exactly how things had ended up this way, but I couldn't help feeling hurt.I moped around school for the next few days and spent my lunches in a quiet corner of the cafeteria reading "One Hundred Years of Solitude," which had just been assigned in Contemporary Lit. On Wednesday afternoon, I looked up to see Rosanne Milton and Violet Woods approaching my table. Roseanne was Jessa's best friend, and I wondered what possible interest she could have in me at this point. But it was Violet who commanded my attention.Violet Woods. There were no other girls like Violet, and her name was spoken reverently and wistfully by nearly every boy at Rindge & Latin. Today she was wearing a tight black leather jacket and a dark miniskirt that accented her astonishing curves and slender, shapely legs, laced up in black mid-calf Doc Martens. When she walked her hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall at sunset and her wide hips swung to their own marvelous rhythm.It's been my blessing and my curse to be in the same class as Violet every year since Kindergarten. Even in high school, we've had at least one class together each year. Violet has always been the prettiest girl in any class, and in junior high, her mere physical presence was enough to utterly flummox and distract me and the other boys, to the point where teachers would deliberately seat her on the far side of the classroom. In grade school, when Valentine's Day arrived, I would spread my store-bought Valentine's Day cards across the dining room table and then agonize over which one best conveyed the depths of my feelings for her. At age 10, I filled three spiral bound notebooks with romantic reflections. I wrote love sonnets in iambic pentameter. I was smitten.The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long, and by the time I turned fourteen, my ardor had cooled. It was not that Violet was any less desirable. Rather, I'd come to the realization that she was unattainable and I, as a mere mortal, should focus my sights on more realistic goals. But really, I had never stopped carrying the torch for her.Today Roseanne was wearing her characteristic look of thinly-veiled disgust, as if someone had just farted under her nose. "Hey Lars," she said, "put down the book and talk to us." She pulled out a chair and sat down in it backwards like a detective in the interrogation room. Violet remained standing beside her and gave me a shy little smile when she caught me staring."So Jessa got an A minus on her paper," said Roseanne. "Heart of Darkness. Just thought you'd want to know.""I'm happy for her," I said."I guess some actual studying occurred when the two of you got together.""Yes, it did.""That's good to hear. Surprised you found the time, though.""Why am I even talking about this with you?" I asked. I didn't care much for Roseanne and I was in no mood for her games."I usually try to stay far away from Jessa's romantic entanglements," she said. "But this one seemed particularly intriguing. Violet thought so too.""It's like there's this whole side of you that we never knew about," said Violet, curling a strand of amber hair around her finger."What do you mean?" I asked. No one answered, but Violet sort of giggled and Roseanne sneered at me."So are you and Jessa like, a thing now?" asked Violet."She told me to get lost yesterday.""Don't take it personal," said Roseanne, "she's always been funny about boys.""Funny like how?""Listen, I know you're dying to figure her out, but it's a lost cause. I love her dearly, but she's a crazy slut. And there's plenty of fish in the sea." She stood up and without another word, sauntered off across the cafeteria. I thought Violet would follow but she didn't move."Lars, can I ask you something," she said."Sure, what is it?" I asked, wondering what Violet Woods would possibly need to ask me."I need a research partner for that paper in Euro History. You have one yet?""No," I said."So -- will you be my partner?" she asked, smiling flirtatiously and cocking her head to one side."Yes. Of course." I couldn't comprehend why she would want to be my partner, after showing no interest in me whatsoever for the last thirteen years, but there was no way I could refuse her. Probably she figured that since I helped Jessa, I could to help her too."You're the best." Her smile lit up her beautiful face, emerald eyes sparkling, and I wondered how on earth I was going to be able to concentrate on schoolwork if we worked together."Text me and we can figure out a time to get together," she said, reaching into her jacket pocket and handing me a business card under the name "Ultra Violet Productions." I was about to ask her about this but when I looked up, she had disappeared.Had Violet Woods just given me her phone number? Indeed, she had. It was certainly a significant turn of events. My head was swimming, and I felt like I was in the seventh grade again and Violet had just asked to borrow my pen and I was positively glowing with the knowledge that she had spoken to me and acknowledged my existence. And then I felt ridiculous for feeling this way, a grown man, at age eighteen, swooning because a pretty girl talked to him. But I made sure to tuck the card snugly in my wallet so there was no chance that it could fall out.CHAPTER 7On Thursdays I volunteer in the greenhouse, which is located behind the science classrooms on the third floor. It's a relaxing and undemanding job, mostly I inspect the plants, water them, trim dead leaves, and check the water quality in the various aquatic environments. Today's Tuesday, so I'm not working, but I made plans to meet Violet here to go over our research project. Ostensibly, we are supposed to be discussing our research on Britain's involvement in World War I. But the truth is, I haven't been able to stop thinking about Violet, and how she's sort of forced her way into my life. I feel like there's something here that I'm missing, that maybe some cruel joke is being played on me that everyone else is in on.Violet's already ten minutes late, giving me plenty of time to ruminate. For all my fantasizing about her, Occam's Razor certainly applies here. Which is the simpler explanation? Violet needs help with the research paper and is being nice to me so I will help her? Or alternatively, somehow, after 13 years, Violet has developed a sudden romantic interest in me that she never had before? The answer seems pretty clear."Lars?" I turn to see her standing in the doorway. "Sorry I'm late." She winds her way through the rows of plants to where I'm standing. Her hair is fastened in strawberry blonde pigtails and she's wearing skin tight jeans and a black tank top that's struggling in vain to contain her ample breasts. It's hard not to stare and I have to remind myself to act casual."No worries," I say, feeling relieved that she's actually shown up."What are these?" she asks, pointing to some small distinctive looking plants in a pot beside her."Monilaria obconica. They call it rabbit succulent.""Oh my God, that's so cute," she says, "they totally look like little bunnies popping out of their burrows!""Yeah. The ears keep growing and eventually they don't look so much like rabbits anymore, so you caught them at the perfect time.""This place is so cool!" she says, looking around. "I don't think I've been in here since freshman year.""Let's find a place to sit." I lead her to the far corner of the greenhouse where there's a beat-up couch, surrounded by the larger leafy tropical plants."It's like being in a Rousseau painting," she says, sitting down beside me and looking around."Yeah, I like it here. Sort of an oasis." I brought a peanut butter and banana sandwich, which is normally a favorite, but I'm suddenly embarrassed to be eating it in front of Violet, so I take a furtive bite and shove it back in my bag. For a moment neither of us says anything. My mind is going a dozen directions at once; overwhelmed with being alone in this lush, damp greenhouse with Violet Woods. The only sound is the gurgle of the aquariums where the aquatic plants grow. It seems to me that electricity is building in the air, like before a summer storm, but I'm probably just imagining it."Lars," she says, "are you okay? You seem preoccupied.""No, I'm fine. We should get to work."Violet doesn't seem very interested in getting to work. "This is literally the only peaceful place in this school," she says, "I would totally just come here and meditate if I was having a stressful day. You ever do that?""Not really. But I have taken a few naps in here.""That's good too," she says. We sit in silence for a moment and I'm thinking we should probably get to work before lunch ends."Did you realize that you and I have been in the same class together since kindergarten?" she says, resting her hand nonchalantly on my knee.I'm shocked that she's even aware of this fact. It threatens to upend the whole narrative in my mind that Violet has barely been aware of my existence."Uh—yeah. I think that's right," I reply. I pretend like her hand on my knee is the most natural thing in the world."You remember Mr. Torrance?" she asks."Oh, yeah. That terrible substitute. Fifth grade, right?""He used to make us listen to those military marches.""That one time he threw Craig Ordal's lunch across the room and it splattered all over the blackboard.""Did you know that he tried to ask my mom out?" she says. "During a parent teacher conference!""What a creep.""He knew she'd just been divorced. She told him to get lost. Totally not her type.""Dodged a bullet there. What if they'd hit it off?""Meet your new dad!" Violet laughs, her hand squeezing my knee. We sit in silence for a moment. I can smell her perfume, the same scent she's worn since freshman year. I'm not sure what's going to happen next, but somehow it feels comfortable just sitting here with her."We've known each other almost our whole lives." she says, thoughtfully. "Thirteen years. How come we hardly ever spoke to each other?"I tried to talk to her many times, but it never seemed to go anywhere. She had no recollection of this because she'd probably never thought twice about it."I don't really know," I say."Was I ever mean to you?""No, not at all. It's just that I was—I didn't know what to say to you.""Was there something you wanted to say?" she asks.Her big emerald eyes are fixed on mine now, piercing and incandescent, and I'm transfixed by them, like a rabbit staring into oncoming headlights. It's as if they're gazing inside me, laying bare my secret fantasies and obsessions. It's an overcast day, but the greenhouse feels hotter than it's ever been, condensation dripping down the walls. A little voice inside tells me that if there was ever a moment to be honest with Violet, this is that moment. "I wanted to say a lot of things," I reply. "It's silly, but . . . I had the biggest crush on you."Violet smiles, and it lights up her entire face, her eyes now warm and sparkling."It's not silly at all," she says, leaning in and planting a long, wet kiss on my mouth. Her lips are soft and warm and taste like strawberry candy. I'm paralyzed for a moment, but my mouth opens to accept hers, and I'm thinking about what it must be like to be Violet Woods, to be so confident and so physically desirable that you can seduce some guy during lunch without breaking a sweat.She pulls me close, her other hand grasps my thigh and I feel the undeniable swell of her breasts pushing against me. Her tongue tentatively explores my mouth, our bodies pressed tightly together now. Many years ago, for two wondrous minutes at the sixth grade formal, Violet and I had slow-danced together, arms-length, until she suggested we get some punch and then disappeared into the crowd. The memory resurfaces, and I wonder briefly how we got from there to here, and then she's kissing me eagerly, her hand entwined in my hair, and I'm kissing her back, her soft lips pressed against mine and our tongues dancing together."Lars," she whispers in my ear."Yes?" I gasp."You taste like peanut butter." She licks her lips playfully.Before I can say anything, she leans back on the couch and pulls off her tank top, revealing her astonishingly full, round breasts, barely contained by the smallest black lace brassiere. I stare, dazedly, my cock lying stiff and hard against my pant leg. She giggles and beckons me over, fully aware of the effect she's having on me.I tentatively place my hands on her breasts. They're firm but soft, warm to the touch, and so large that I'm not sure where I should put my hands first. I can feel her nipples stiffening beneath her lingerie. I caress them gently with my thumbs and she moans and arches her back. Her hand slides across my thigh to where my cock is straining at my jeans and she grabs hold of it, stroking it through the fabric."Oh god Lars" she moans, and I keep stroking and massaging her breasts, thinking that I could really do this all day if I had to. Suddenly she sits up and thrusts her tongue into my mouth again, and we're kissing forcefully, twisting and thrashing on the couch, both of us thoroughly aroused and desperate, oblivious to the fact that we're in the school building.She pushes me backwards onto the couch and straddles me, and I catch a glint of something primal in her eyes, a predator closing in on her prey. She pulls open her jeans and lowers them to reveal her black lace panties. Her belly is pale and flat and her wide hips are moving sinuously like a belly dancer.She thrusts her hand into her panties and begins to finger herself vigorously. She throws her head back and moans and then starts bucking her hips ferociously, rubbing her ass back and forth along my shaft where it lies helplessly, hard and swollen, inside my jeans. She rides me like this until I'm literally shaking with anticipation and the only thing I want in the whole world is for her to pull my cock out of its denim prison.All of a sudden, we can hear voices coming from the classrooms adjacent to the greenhouse.In a flash, Violet stands up, buttons her jeans and pulls on her shirt. I can't comprehend how she can react so fast, I'm so overwhelmed that I can barely move. She glances warily toward the classrooms for a moment, then kisses me lightly on the cheek and disappears, leaving the lingering smell of her perfume and my painful hard-on as the only traces that she was ever here.I sleepwalk through the rest of the day in a dazed and euphoric state, replaying our encounter in my mind over and over, with a dull ache in my balls that doesn't go away for several hours.That night at 1 a.m. I'm awakened by a text alert on my phone. I glance over at the screen to see it's a message from Violet."Hiya Lars." Instantly I'm awake and fumbling with my phone."Hey," I write."Sorry 2 run out. Had fun studying LOL.""So did I.""Come see me Friday 9pm? 25 Forest Street. Sweet dreams."I don't get much sleep for the rest of the night. <|endoftext|> "For a start, just pounding me as fast as you can isn't going to do it.""I don't get many complaints.""Most girls don't know any better."He chuckled indignantly at me. "But you clearly do. So what would you suggest?""Maybe try understanding what a girl responds to, what's working for her.""I'd say it worked pretty well for you," he replied. He was just baiting me now, and it was making me angry."You asked for my advice and I gave it to you. I'm sure you think you gave me the fuck of a lifetime but honestly, all I'm going to remember about tonight is how sore I was the next day."He stared at me blankly for a moment and then leaned back and laughed. "I doubt that very much," he said."And that took like what -- five minutes? If I'm being generous?""You're the one who wants to leave," he said, patting the bulge in his sweatpants. "I'm here all night.""Yeah, no thanks." I stood up and headed for the door. I wasn't going to give him the satisfaction of provoking me into a rage. He stood up, blocking my way."We should see each other again," he said. "Second time's a charm.""I really don't think so.""Because you know it's true.""You had your shot.""Just think about it," he said, moving aside to let me pass. "You'll be back here soon enough and we can have some real fun." I brushed past him and out the front door without another word. Before closing the door, I turned back for a second."Oh, and work on the dirty talk," I said. "It's fucking corny."CHAPTER 4Mom has tonight off so we're having mother-daughter night which traditionally consists of Chinese food, followed by a movie which Mom always chooses, and which is always from before 1980. Since we both share a love of spicy food, our go-to for Chinese is Szechuan Mountain House. Mom is partial to Ma-Po Tofu and I order Dan Dan Noodles and a pile of spicy pickled veggies.On mother-daughter night, Mom always asks me if there are any special guys right now. Invariably, the answer is no. I tell her I have no interest in seeing anyone."You've said that before," she says, "but I've never understood why. Did you get tired of boys?""Not all of them. I just don't want to, you know, date them.""Dating just means you spend some time with someone, see if there's a connection.""I don't need to date anyone to be in a relationship," I tell her. "I can get to know them naturally, you know -- organically.""Organically?""Just hanging out with a guy, on my own terms. No bullshit. No obligation. If it happens, it happens.""And the guys are fine with this?" she asks."I mean, they don't have much choice.""Okay," she says, "so let me ask my question differently. Are there any guys you like just hanging out with, on your own terms?"Yeah, mom, I think to myself, I met this swell guy Archer last night, what a sweetheart, let me tell you. Hung like a horse, and you know, the reason I spent all day on the couch was because he railed me so hard that I was too fucking sore to walk.What I actually say is: "Not really."I think about it for a moment. "I hung out with this guy Lars from school last week, he helped me with a paper.""Tell me about Lars," she says."I dunno. Not much to say really. He's kind of shy and bookish but he's a nice guy, not some asshole.""Is he cute?""Yeah, fine, mom, he's cute. Happy now?"You going to spend time with him again?""I doubt it.""Well, whatever happens, try to be nice to him," she says. And like that, the discussion is over and then we're clearing the take-out containers and putting the leftovers in the fridge.Once dinner is cleaned up, we retire to the couch. Tonight's movie is "Bringing Up Baby," which has an off-putting title, but it turns out "Baby" is really a disobedient pet leopard and it stars Cary Grant as the world's most dashing palaeontologist. The ritual demands that after the movie is over, we discuss it over a pint of Ben & Jerry's."I liked it," says Mom. "I didn't know Katherine Hepburn could be so funny.""What bothers me is that the character's just a male fantasy. The quirky mystery woman who magically appears to show the stuffy scientist what he's been missing his whole life.""Well, it was made eighty years ago," Mom says."It happens in movies all the time.""I suppose.""And now there's all these guys convinced that they need some unpredictable, free-spirited girl to show them the way.""You meet a lot of these guys?" she asks."Yeah. Some."Mom is yawning and it's not long before she heads to bed. Once her light is out, I dig what's left of that joint out of my desk drawer and head up to the roof of our building.It's a cloudy night and no stars can be seen. I light the joint and take the smoke deep into my lungs. I wish I hadn't brought Lars up at dinner, but he's been on my mind lately. It's been nine days since he was over here and I've very obviously been avoiding him at school. Boys can get so attached the moment you show them any interest, so I've found it's best to set boundaries. On the other hand, I can't just keep avoiding him, it's not practical. And, in fairness, Lars isn't just any boy. Somehow it feels like we've been through a lot together even though it was really just a single night. I'm starting to feel bad about blowing him off. If nothing else, I owe him an explanation.Mom thinks I'm afraid to be in a relationship, but I'm not interested in her outdated definition of what a relationship is supposed to be. It's not some guy and girl sharing a milkshake like a fucking Norman Rockwell painting. It's however I choose to connect with someone, no one's telling me how I have to do it.I must be high as fuck. There's some leftover Dan Dan Noodles in the fridge and that's where I'm headed next.CHAPTER 5The next day after school, Lars is waiting outside the entrance. He's clearly waiting for me, because no one else is around. It took me thirty minutes after school ended to find the damn art history book I need in in the library, and apparently Lars has been waiting patiently here the whole time."Hey, Lars," I call out.'How are you?" he asks. "I've haven't seen you all week.""Yeah, I'm sorry -- I know I've been kind of distant.""Well—me too, I guess."I'm standing next to him now, practically kissing distance. He looks nervous, like he's afraid of what I'm going to say next."Listen, Lars, I had a good time with you.""Yeah, me too. Absolutely." We're both quiet for a moment."It was kind of a strange night, don't you think?"He thinks about it for a moment. "You know it was my first time, right?""Yeah, I knew.""That obvious, huh?""No, it's just that -- girls usually know.""It was different from how I'd imagined it. Not in a bad way though.""Different can be good," I say, trying to force a smile but not really feeling it."So what happens now?" he asks."I don't know. What do you think?"He hesitates for a moment. "I guess I was hoping I could see you again.""Look, I need to be honest with you," I say, "I don't really ever date anyone. It's just not my thing.""We don't have to date," he says. "We could just hang out, or whatever.""I don't think it's going to work," I say. "It's complicated, Lars—I'm sorry. I'm not trying to tell you to get lost, I'm really not. It's just you—you should make other plans, you know?""I don't have other plans," he replies, staring down at his feet. I can tell he's hurt and angry. I've been in this situation before, and I've always just told myself that I didn't owe it to any of these guys to see them if I wasn't feeling it. But this time, it's hard to justify exactly why I'm treating Lars this way. I'm hurting him for reasons that don't really make sense to me anymore.The silence is excruciating, I need to say something, I can't just blow him off and I really want to try to make him understand."It's got nothing to do with you. It's me -- I can't -- I'm just not able to . . . be anybody's girlfriend.""Yeah, okay. I get it." He jams his hands into his pockets, turns and walks away. I want to call after him but I don't know what more to say and I'll probably only make things worse.CHAPTER 6My fears had now been officially confirmed. I was just a dumb inexperienced guy who got himself all tied up in knots over nothing. I had simply misread the situation. Made a huge deal out of something that was clearly routine for Jessa. I beat myself up afterward for not explaining more thoroughly how I felt, but really there was nothing I could have said that would have made any difference. The truth was, I liked her a lot. She was sensitive and smart, and her sexual confidence and assertiveness really turned me on. She seemed lonely, and I wanted to be someone that could make her feel like she was needed and loved.But it was not to be. I thought we had made a connection, but it was now clear that she had viewed me as a conquest, and having succeeded, she'd moved on. I didn't really understand exactly how things had ended up this way, but I couldn't help feeling hurt.I moped around school for the next few days and spent my lunches in a quiet corner of the cafeteria reading "One Hundred Years of Solitude," which had just been assigned in Contemporary Lit. On Wednesday afternoon, I looked up to see Rosanne Milton and Violet Woods approaching my table. Roseanne was Jessa's best friend, and I wondered what possible interest she could have in me at this point. But it was Violet who commanded my attention.Violet Woods. There were no other girls like Violet, and her name was spoken reverently and wistfully by nearly every boy at Rindge & Latin. Today she was wearing a tight black leather jacket and a dark miniskirt that accented her astonishing curves and slender, shapely legs, laced up in black mid-calf Doc Martens. When she walked her hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall at sunset and her wide hips swung to their own marvelous rhythm.It's been my blessing and my curse to be in the same class as Violet every year since Kindergarten. Even in high school, we've had at least one class together each year. Violet has always been the prettiest girl in any class, and in junior high, her mere physical presence was enough to utterly flummox and distract me and the other boys, to the point where teachers would deliberately seat her on the far side of the classroom. In grade school, when Valentine's Day arrived, I would spread my store-bought Valentine's Day cards across the dining room table and then agonize over which one best conveyed the depths of my feelings for her. At age 10, I filled three spiral bound notebooks with romantic reflections. I wrote love sonnets in iambic pentameter. I was smitten.The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long, and by the time I turned fourteen, my ardor had cooled. It was not that Violet was any less desirable. Rather, I'd come to the realization that she was unattainable and I, as a mere mortal, should focus my sights on more realistic goals. But really, I had never stopped carrying the torch for her.Today Roseanne was wearing her characteristic look of thinly-veiled disgust, as if someone had just farted under her nose. "Hey Lars," she said, "put down the book and talk to us." She pulled out a chair and sat down in it backwards like a detective in the interrogation room. Violet remained standing beside her and gave me a shy little smile when she caught me staring."So Jessa got an A minus on her paper," said Roseanne. "Heart of Darkness. Just thought you'd want to know.""I'm happy for her," I said."I guess some actual studying occurred when the two of you got together.""Yes, it did.""That's good to hear. Surprised you found the time, though.""Why am I even talking about this with you?" I asked. I didn't care much for Roseanne and I was in no mood for her games."I usually try to stay far away from Jessa's romantic entanglements," she said. "But this one seemed particularly intriguing. Violet thought so too.""It's like there's this whole side of you that we never knew about," said Violet, curling a strand of amber hair around her finger."What do you mean?" I asked. No one answered, but Violet sort of giggled and Roseanne sneered at me."So are you and Jessa like, a thing now?" asked Violet."She told me to get lost yesterday.""Don't take it personal," said Roseanne, "she's always been funny about boys.""Funny like how?""Listen, I know you're dying to figure her out, but it's a lost cause. I love her dearly, but she's a crazy slut. And there's plenty of fish in the sea." She stood up and without another word, sauntered off across the cafeteria. I thought Violet would follow but she didn't move."Lars, can I ask you something," she said."Sure, what is it?" I asked, wondering what Violet Woods would possibly need to ask me."I need a research partner for that paper in Euro History. You have one yet?""No," I said."So -- will you be my partner?" she asked, smiling flirtatiously and cocking her head to one side."Yes. Of course." I couldn't comprehend why she would want to be my partner, after showing no interest in me whatsoever for the last thirteen years, but there was no way I could refuse her. Probably she figured that since I helped Jessa, I could to help her too."You're the best." Her smile lit up her beautiful face, emerald eyes sparkling, and I wondered how on earth I was going to be able to concentrate on schoolwork if we worked together."Text me and we can figure out a time to get together," she said, reaching into her jacket pocket and handing me a business card under the name "Ultra Violet Productions." I was about to ask her about this but when I looked up, she had disappeared.Had Violet Woods just given me her phone number? Indeed, she had. It was certainly a significant turn of events. My head was swimming, and I felt like I was in the seventh grade again and Violet had just asked to borrow my pen and I was positively glowing with the knowledge that she had spoken to me and acknowledged my existence. And then I felt ridiculous for feeling this way, a grown man, at age eighteen, swooning because a pretty girl talked to him. But I made sure to tuck the card snugly in my wallet so there was no chance that it could fall out.CHAPTER 7On Thursdays I volunteer in the greenhouse, which is located behind the science classrooms on the third floor.

She pulls open her jeans and lowers them to reveal her black lace panties. Her belly is pale and flat and her wide hips are moving sinuously like a belly dancer.She thrusts her hand into her panties and begins to finger herself vigorously. She throws her head back and moans and then starts bucking her hips ferociously, rubbing her ass back and forth along my shaft where it lies helplessly, hard and swollen, inside my jeans. She rides me like this until I'm literally shaking with anticipation and the only thing I want in the whole world is for her to pull my cock out of its denim prison.All of a sudden, we can hear voices coming from the classrooms adjacent to the greenhouse.In a flash, Violet stands up, buttons her jeans and pulls on her shirt. I can't comprehend how she can react so fast, I'm so overwhelmed that I can barely move. She glances warily toward the classrooms for a moment, then kisses me lightly on the cheek and disappears, leaving the lingering smell of her perfume and my painful hard-on as the only traces that she was ever here.I sleepwalk through the rest of the day in a dazed and euphoric state, replaying our encounter in my mind over and over, with a dull ache in my balls that doesn't go away for several hours.That night at 1 a.m. I'm awakened by a text alert on my phone. I glance over at the screen to see it's a message from Violet."Hiya Lars." Instantly I'm awake and fumbling with my phone."Hey," I write."Sorry 2 run out. Had fun studying LOL.""So did I.""Come see me Friday 9pm? 25 Forest Street. Sweet dreams."I don't get much sleep for the rest of the night.
