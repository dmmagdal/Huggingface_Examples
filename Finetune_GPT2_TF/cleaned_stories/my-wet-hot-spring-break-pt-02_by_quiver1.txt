Copyright 2021, Quiver. All rights reserved.Part 2: Truth or DareOver the course of the next few days, my dalliance with Santiago had apparently become public knowledge among my teammates. They didn't know the full details, but after Kaitlyn and Roach had witnessed that embarrassing encounter with my mother, it was only a matter of time before the rumors started flying. And it seemed to be helping my popularity, too. My teammates wouldn't stop pestering me for all the dirty details. As the quiet kid on the team, it was a lot to take in. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't enjoying the attention.The one exception to the rule was Jessie. She had always been nice to me, despite the fact that we weren't super close, so there wasn't much of a difference in her behavior now. And I was sure she'd heard the rumors, but so far she'd had the tact not to bug me about it.It was a few days into Spring Break in Campeche, and we were finally free to let loose a little since the soccer tournament had ended. So, a lot of us had decided to spend the day at the hotel pool, making heavy use of the poolside cocktail bar and the extremely low Mexican drinking age. It had taken some convincing to get my mom to let me spend the day at the pool, but she finally acquiesced after my dad reminded her that we had won the tournament. Even so, she still made me bring my chemistry textbook with me so that I could get some studying done "in my free moments".Jessie took it upon herself to keep me company while I dutifully tried to study, but we ended up chatting for a few hours by the side of the pool as our teammates splashed around in the water. It turned out that Jessie was super easy to talk to, and now that I had a little bit of confidence and didn't pull away every time she asked me a question or tried to talk to me, we were really getting along. She even bought my drinks so that they didn't show up as a room charge for my mom to get angry about.Our conversation meandered from topic to topic, everywhere from our excitement and fears about college, to some bad childhood memories, to how boring Dr. Thomas's history class was. Talking to her was so natural. Even the lulls in the conversation felt fluid and painless. Though, to be fair, it didn't hurt that we were both on our third margarita."Ughhh, she's so beautifullll" Jessie said with a painful groan, interrupting the relative silence that had been building over the past few minutes."Who?" I asked, "Kaitlyn?" looking over to see who Jessie was looking at. "Yeah, she's pretty. So are you, though," I replied."No, that's not what I mean," Jessie responded, shaking her head in mild annoyance. "She's gorgeous"."I guess so," I said, not really sure what I was supposed to say. "But Jessie, you're beautiful. You don't have anything to worry about. You're just as gorgeous as Kaitlyn. Maybe even more so." I wasn't lying when I said that. Sure, Kaitlyn was classically hot, but Jessie was adorable. The way her red curls framed her face, and that infectious sideways smile... Plus she was kind, and funny... it wasn't even a contest in my book."Nooooo," Jessie replied emphatically, her glass sloshing and threatening to fall out of her grasp. "That's not what I mean. I'm not jealous of her."I was utterly confused at this point. "What do you mean, then?" I asked cautiously.Jessie let out a heavy sigh. "I think I might love her," she said quietly. She sounded like she was about to cry. She took another sip in what looked like an effort to hold back tears.I paused, finally understanding what Jessie had meant, but still unsure of what to say. "Oh," I said, trying not to sound judgmental. "I didn't know you were..." I trailed off a little."A big lesbo?" Jessie replied with a sharp laugh."No!" I denied instinctively. "That's not—I mean, I didn't know you were into girls, that's all.""Why would you have known?" Jessie replied, a slight edge in her voice. Clearly this wasn't easy for her to talk about."How long have you? Known, I mean," I asked gently."I don't know," Jessie said. "Always?" She paused for a few seconds. "When everyone else went boy crazy in middle school, I just, never did. It kind of slowly dawned on me after a while that I never really cared about boys the way the other girls did. I mean, they're fine as friends and everything, but I never saw any guy as anything more than that. And then Kaitlyn happened," her voice trailed off wistfully."But haven't you and Kaitlyn been close for like, years?" I asked."Five. Yeah." Jessie gave another heavy sigh and leaned over into her hands. "I'm so pathetic.""Hey," I said, placing my hand on Jessie's back. "You're not pathetic. You're like the coolest person I know!""You're not weirded out?" Jessie asked as she looked up at me, a deep fear evident in her eyes. I had never seen her so vulnerable. It broke my heart to see her so afraid."Of course not!" I replied, holding eye contact as I said so. "Jessie, I'm just sorry you're having to deal with this all on your own. It's gotta be hell to be in love with your best friend, on top of all the other stuff you're having to work through. But the gay thing, it doesn't matter to me at all. You're exactly the same awesome Jessie you were ten minutes ago."Jessie smiled at me. "You're pretty awesome yourself, Vernon," she said, her voice reverting back to its usual levity. She cleared her throat emphatically, obviously eager to change topics. "So, you gonna tell me about that dude everyone saw you with? Way I hear it, we can't call you "Virgin" anymore," she said with her usual easy smile as she elbowed me in the side.I blushed, biting my bottom lip in embarrassment."Hey, I just spilled the deepest darkest secrets of my heart here," Jessie said with feigned indignation. "You have to tell me about your boytoy. It's only fair," she said with satisfaction, leaning back in her chair and taking a big sip of her margarita as she looked at me expectantly.I grinned back at her while shaking my head, astounded at her ability to get what she wanted out of me while still being so infectiously wholesome at the same time."Fine!" I said, unable to get rid of the grin on my face. "His name is Santiago. I met him at a bar near the market."Jessie furrowed her brow in suspicion. "A bar," she repeated flatly. "What were you doing at a bar? Were you by yourself?"Looking down and glancing back up at her from the corner of my eye, I replied, "Maybe..."Jessie sat up and opened her eyes wide at me, giving me a "what the fuck" kind of look."I know!" I replied with a squeak. "I know! It wasn't my smartest moment.""Jesus, Quinn. If you wanted to drink you should have come out with us!" Jessie said."It was just an impulse," I replied. "I just wanted to get away from my parents for a little while."Jessie nodded with a sad smile. "Yeah, they seem to ride you pretty hard.""It's fine," I said quickly. "I don't have much to complain about. They can just be... a lot sometimes."Jessie nodded again. "Hey," she started, giving me a serious look. "If you ever want to get away from them, you can always call me, you know? Like, when we get back home. You're really cool, Quinn. I've always thought so—you just need to come out of your shell a little bit. And you can't do that with your parents breathing over your shoulder every second of every day."I gave her a half-smile. "Thanks," I said. "That means a lot, really. And you too. I mean, if you ever want to talk about stuff. I know it can't be easy, carrying all that around.""Thanks, dude," Jessie said with her easy smile. Watching her sipping her drink, feeling how easy she was to talk to, I couldn't for the life of me explain why we hadn't been close before this. I couldn't quite explain it, but I wanted nothing more than to just hang out with her forever. She made me feel so... light. She radiated joy and seemed to spread it to anyone she was near. I could tell from that moment that we were going to be great friends.That night the entire team had plans to have a girls' night in at the hotel, in Jessie, Kaitlyn and Roach's suite. My parents had relented since the tournament was over, and I was taking fourth spot in their room for the rest of vacation. I was feeling really excited to hang out with the team without my parents around, and bonding with Jessie earlier had given me a newfound confidence that I could actually be social with my teammates. Tonight was going to be fun.A few hours later, after a big dinner where we all sobered up, Roach came back with the tequila and things got going with the usual girls night drinking games. We skipped "Spin the Bottle" because there weren't any guys with us, and no one was willing to suggest it without the cover of heterosexuality. I briefly thought about suggesting it for Jessie's sake, but I figured she probably wouldn't appreciate me meddling, and I didn't want to cause her any extra embarrassment or heartache. So first up was "Never Have I Ever".I was the butt of quite a few of my teammates' "Never Have I Ever" prompts. Roach was up first, starting off with the heavy-hitting "Never have I ever... been caught by my mom making out on a street corner with some guy I barely know." Since by this point my escapades were common knowledge throughout the entire soccer team, this was met with uproarious laughter. And of course, as the only one that fit the description, I had to take a shot of tequila.I came back swinging, though. "Okay fine, never have I ever... gone by the name of a disgusting insect my entire life."Roach looked up with feigned shock, placing her hand across her chest in defense. "Hey, I wouldn't be throwing any stones about nicknames, Virgin. And anyway, you'd go by Roach too if your parents had named you Rhonda! Anyway, I like it," she added with pure self-possession. She took her shot with a laugh.Next up was Jessie. Jumping on Roach's bandwagon, she capitalized on her knowledge gained in our previous conversation by saying, "Never have I ever... gone to a Mexican bar in the middle of the day by myself to pick up guys." The rest of the team looked confused at that one, but they got the hint fairly quickly after they saw Jessie staring at me expectantly. I took another shot. And the entire team exploded in laughter again. My adventures were apparently a source of endless amusement.After that, they still didn't let up. But they didn't know the details of what had happened, so they were left playing a guessing game with me.Lara went next, guessing, "Never have I ever... given a Mexican guy I barely know a blowjob." I didn't drink at that one, to everyone's loudly expressed disappointment.Next it was Sophie: "Never have I ever... given a Mexican guy I barely know a HANDJOB." I grimaced and took a shot. I was pretty sure what I had done with Santiago would constitute a handjob, even if he was the one who... brought it to completion. Another uproar at my expense.I started to sway a little bit as the three shots in such quick succession caught up with me. If they didn't cool it with this, I was going to pass out before the end of the first game.Jessie saw me start to lean, and quickly spoke up. "Hey guys, let's take it easy on Quinn, okay? She's a lightweight." She turned to look at me, placing her hand on my cheek. "You doing okay?""Yeah," I said, leaning into her hand slightly. "I'm just not used to all that."Jessie turned back to the group and said, "Looks like Vernon's outpacing us anyway. I say we catch up with her! Can't let her have all the fun!" Jessie winked at me as she took a shot, and the rest of the team followed suit.They settled back into the game, but stopped focusing on me for the rest of it. And predictably, those three shots were the only three I had to take the entire game. I might have done a crazy thing by going to that park with Santiago, but apparently it was basically the only interesting fact about me.Roach inevitably won (or lost, depending on your point of view), since she was by far the most sexually experienced of the bunch. A few of the teammates went back to their own rooms after that game, but there were still six of us left. The remaining girls were itching to try something else. We were in a foreign country, so it looked like prank calls were out of the question. So that left us only one option. Truth or Dare.Since we'd been playing an indirect form of "Truth" already, most of the girls were eager to move on to the "Dare" part of the game. We started small. There were a few dares to take more shots, a couple of goofy harmless ones like singing a stupid song or making a weird face. But we quickly started to escalate.At one point Roach decided it would be funny to dare Lara to strip naked and streak around the ground floor of the hotel. It took a lot of convincing, but once Roach offered to go with her, Lara agreed. It was a hilarious sight, lanky Lara with her mosquito bite tits standing next to busty, top-heavy Roach. They were both good looking eighteen-year-old high school seniors, but they couldn't have been more different.We stood at the balcony while the two of them ran a lap around the building together stark nude, laughing and cheering them on. I glanced over at Jessie. I'd never really hung out with a lesbian before, and with these beautiful naked girls running around, I imagined she was in heaven. Hell, I wasn't gay, and I couldn't help but stare. But she wasn't even looking at Roach and Lara. She made a show of cheering for them, but I could tell that her attention was focused on Kaitlyn. How had I not seen it before? She had the tell-tale look of a teenage girl lost in the clutches of first love. For that matter, how could Kaitlyn not know? I'd have killed to have someone look at me the way Jessie was looking at Kaitlyn.After Roach and Lara were done with their streaking, hey came back up to our room giggling uncontrollably. They were pretty sure the front desk manager had seen them, but he hadn't said anything or told them to stop. We all felt quite emboldened, and the dares kept getting more and more sexual, and more and more extreme.Kaitlyn was the only person who seemed particularly averse to dares, and consistently chose "truth" when her turn came around, which was starting to get a little annoying to everyone.In an ironic twist of fate, during the next round Lara decided to dare Jessie to make out with Kaitlyn, thereby circumventing Kaitlyn's adamant refusal to take dares. Knowing what I knew, I couldn't help but notice Jessie's signs of nervousness. But she hid all of her nerves behind her usual easy-going demeanor.Jessie put on a wide smile and leaned over toward Kaitlyn. Kaitlyn leaned in and Jessie delicately placed her hand on the side of Kaitlyn's neck, just below the ear. Watching them about to kiss, I was surprised at how shallow my breath became. I imagined a hand on my neck like that, and it sent shivers down my sides. I felt my nipples beneath my shirt start to ache, as the sexual tension emanating off of Jessie flooded over me.Jessie leaned in and I watched as her lips met Kaitlyn's. It was brief, but beautiful. Their mouths were slightly open, and I caught a glimpse of their tongues darting together for a moment. I felt my clit spasm as I imagined what it would feel like to kiss like that. My only real experience had been from Santiago shoving his rough, aggressive, cigarette-flavored tongue down my throat. What Jessie and Kaitlyn were doing looked like heaven in comparison.It ended quicker than I would have liked, with Kaitlyn pulling away with a giggle. Jessie did a good job hiding her disappointment and went back to her drink.Finally, Roach got a look on her face and decided that it was time to push Kaitlyn's buttons a little bit further. "Okay, Kaitlyn," she started. "Are you finally going to actually play the game and take a dare? What's it gonna be: Truth or dare?""Wait, I just kissed Jessie!" Kaitlyn retorted.Roach shook her head, biting her lip with devious excitement. "That was Jessie's dare! You still have to go!"Kaitlyn paused for a brief moment as she watched Roach's demeanor, but rolled her eyes and flipped her long blonde hair in exasperation. "Truth."Apparently that was exactly what Roach had wanted to hear. "Okay..." she said mischievously. "But be warned, I'm not going to go easy on you this time. If you really want to do truth again, you're going to have to tell everyone about that thing."Kaitlyn's face fell as her mouth dropped open. Apparently Roach knew something the rest of us didn't, because it was written all over Kaitlyn's face that she had a major secret. "What thing?" Kaitlyn asked, with a feigned ignorance that fooled no one.Roach gave Kaitlyn a knowing look. "Come on, Kait," she said, "You know what I'm talking about. You know, the thing that happened last fall..."Kaitlyn's eyes shot open in horror. "Roach!" she exclaimed with genuine fear. "You promised you'd never tell anyone about that!"Roach smiled slyly, "You're right, Kaitlyn. And I'd never break that promise! But we never said anything about you telling people about it. Now, truth or dare?"Kaitlyn looked completely trapped. But after a moment of indecision, she seemed to make up her mind as she looked back at Roach in defiance. "Dare."Roach smiled again, this time with genuine glee. "Finally!"Roach, smiled smugly while she leaned in conspiratorially with Sophie and Lara as they discussed what Kaitlyn's dare would be. At this point, everyone was solidly drunk, and our decision-making powers were not functioning at the highest levels. Roach emerged from their little mini-huddle with a shit-eating grin on her face."I dare you to go downstairs and give the guy at the front desk a blowjob," Roach said to Kaitlyn.Kaitlyn's shoulder's slumped at that suggestion. "That's way too far, Roach," she protested.Roach just shrugged and said, "Hey, if you want to do truth, just say the word!"Kaitlyn looked completely at a loss. But as anxious as Kaitlyn seemed, Jessie looked even more distraught. I could tell that the idea of Kaitlyn blowing a guy right downstairs was going to be devastating for her.I felt a huge swelling of sympathy for Jessie, and at the same time I felt emboldened to take action in a way that would have seemed completely foreign to me just a week before. Already itching with sexual frustration after having watched Jessie make out with Kaitlyn, and feeling adventurous after my adventure with Santiago, I acted on impulse once again and exclaimed, "I'll do it!"Everyone in the room turned toward me as my words reached their ears. I think if it had been anyone else, it wouldn't have worked. But the fact that it was me, meek and quiet Quinn Vernon the Virgin, volunteering to take one for the team, sealed the deal.Lara and Sophie erupted in laughter, and Roach's smile got even wider than before, her eyes lighting up at the idea. "Hell, yeah, Virgin!" she cheered. Kaitlyn looked relieved that the attention was no longer on her. And when I looked over at Jessie, she looked like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders, though she still wasn't back to her usual happy self. She seemed strangely withdrawn and didn't really make eye contact with me. But everyone else had swarmed over to me, giving me encouraging punches on the arm and giggling like maniacs. We had all definitely reached the tipping point of the night in terms of alcohol and reckless decisions. It seemed that my impulsive proclamation had successfully redirected the entire group's attention from Kaitlyn over to myself, and I was absolutely loving it. Growing up as the smart, quiet kid I had really never experienced true peer pressure. And my soccer teammates were more than willing to provide it at this moment.As their excitement started to abate, Roach got back down to business. "Okay, Virgin," she said conspiratorially. "When we were down there, there was just the one guy manning the front desk. He definitely saw us streaking, and we didn't get in trouble, so we know he's willing to look past at least some stuff. I think it's likely that he enjoyed the show," she said with a wicked smile. "So he's probably already... ready for you," she finished.I could feel my heart in my throat as it hit me that I was actually about to go seduce a grown adult man. This wasn't like that thing with Santiago. That had happened more or less organically. Yeah, I had gone out with the intention of having some kind of wild experience, but it had been a vague sense of rebellion, and the decision to go to that park had been just as much Santiago's idea as mine. This was different. I was going to be literally trying to give this guy a blow job. Shit! A blow job! I'd never given anyone a blow job before! What if I sucked at it? What if it tasted terrible? Was he going to cum in my mouth? Is that safe? Should he wear a condom for a blow job?The thoughts started spiraling out of control and I was reeling from the attention, to the point where my eyes must have looked like a deer in headlights.Jessie seemed to notice that I was feeling a bit overwhelmed and she scooted over to me, placing her hand between my shoulder blades as she rubbed my back. "You don't have to do this, you know," she said. "You don't have to prove anything to us."Hearing Jessie's kind words calmed my racing thoughts and eased the building panic within me. I looked at her and remembered why I had volunteered in the first place. So that it wasn't Kaitlyn blowing a random dude while Jessie sat up here heartbroken and imagining her crush with a dick in her mouth. My resolve came back, along with a healthy dose of excitement at the idea of giving my first blow job."I know," I responded firmly, finally settling down with a smile. "I want to!"The rest of the girls cheered at that, and Jessie seemed satisfied enough with my response. They all quickly decided to give me an impromptu makeover to make me look as slutty as possible. Which basically just consisted of Roach slathering on eye shadow and lip gloss, while Sophie mussed my hair. They decided I couldn't go down there in my pajama pants and t-shirt, so they gathered the sluttiest clothes everyone had brought to find me an outfit.It ended up being a shiny bodycon dress of Lara's. I had always had an athletic build, which meant I was never super skinny. So I was shocked that Lara's dress would fit me, but it was made of stretchy material, so it turned out to be no problem. Except that on me it was so short that the dimples below my ass cheeks were visible. They insisted that I not wear any panties, "just in case". Kaitlyn lent me some heels she had brought, and I was ready to go.I glanced in the mirror and almost didn't recognize myself. The outermost layer of my naturally chestnut brown hair was bleached almost entirely blonde because of all the time I'd spent in the sun over the past week, and my skin was several shades darker than usual. Combined with the outfit, I looked easily 20 years old. I'd never worn anything quite like that dress before, either. It hugged every curve, curves I hadn't realized I had. I had hips, apparently.The team seemed pleased with the results as well. Roach whistled at me and made me do a spin in front of the rest of the girls, and I briefly caught Jessie's eyes flitting down over my body as I turned back around, her head cocked ever so slightly. That sent a tingle through me as I realized that Jessie had been checking me out. I felt my face flush as her eyes lifted back up to meet mine. But rather than displaying any embarrassment, she just raised her eyebrows at me and smiled."Okay," Roach said, pulling my attention away from Jessie. "I think you're ready.""Oh, wait," I objected, "What if he says no?"Roach laughed at that. "He's not gonna say no," she replied with confidence, "Not when the girl offering looks like that. But I'll tell you what: if you actually offer the dude a blowjob, like really try, and he still says no, then you'll have completed the dare." Roach paused briefly, thinking. "But if he says yes... and he will, you have to actually do it!" she added emphatically.I nodded in acknowledgment, feeling the rush of adrenaline course through my body again, and an aching sensation building between my legs.The girls and I made our way down to the lobby. It was late enough that the rest of the guests had all gone to bed, and Roach had been right about there only being a single guy manning the front desk.As soon as we saw him, Roach took charge. She told the rest of the team to sit down on the couches nearby to watch, while she led me over to the front desk. Roach marched us right up to the manager, whose name tag told me his name was Pablo, and practically shoved me toward him.Pablo seemed to be about 40. He was kind of short, and a little old for my eighteen-year old tastes, but handsome enough for his age. He looked over at the two of us, glancing behind us as he noticed the gaggle of four other giggling teenagers clearly watching from the couches. I noticed his eyes linger on my bare thighs as he gave me a once-over.My worries that he wouldn't be interested in me started to fade as I watched his tongue subtly move across his teeth as he continued to undress me with his eyes. I bit my lip as my own arousal swelled at the thought of him admiring and lusting after my body. Adrenaline and determination fueled my movements as I stood closer to him, allowing my hand to brush across his bicep as I stared up at him demurely.I couldn't help myself from continuing to bite my lower lip in a pout as I let my eyelids flutter. I felt a surge of boldness I'd never felt before, and allowed myself to speak.Spanish words flowed out of me with ease, with that classic false sense of fluency that comes with a bit too much alcohol. I'm sure the sentences that came out were nowhere close to fully grammatical, but Pablo didn't seem to care. I told him my name. I told him I thought he was handsome. I asked him if he thought I was pretty. With each sentence, the movements of my hand on his arm got a little more fluid, a little more confident, and Pablo seemed to be growing more comfortable with the entire situation.His eyes dropped to my chest when I asked him if he found me pretty. It was Pablo's turn to bite his lip as he nodded firmly, clearly happy to continue the line of questioning. I moved in a little closer, letting my hand wander across Pablo's chest and stomach. "Quieres tocarme?" I asked sweetly, nodding down to my breasts.Pablo let out a grunt of affirmation as his right hand reached up to cup my breast. Before I knew it, I felt his other hand grab my ass, pulling me firmly against his midsection. Immediately I could feel his erection pressing against my belly. I closed my eyes in a grimace as I felt my own body respond to his. Flashes of Santiago's swollen member flooded through my mind. How desperately I wanted that thick cock inside me. My pussy spasmed of its own accord as Pablo shoved his tongue into my mouth in a wet, aggressive kiss. I felt his hand move down from my breast and slide between my legs, as he started to kiss the side of my face and all along my neck.Since my friends had convinced me not to wear underwear, Pablo's hand immediately found my slit, now slick and wet with juices. A soft moan escaped my lips as his rough fingers explored my pussy lips and his teeth scraped along the soft skin of my throat. He clearly knew his way around the female body, and I found myself gasping with pleasure as he fondled me. He groaned with eagerness as he slipped his index finger inside me, grinding his thumb across my clit as he did so.I had never experienced pleasure like this with another person. My excursion with Santiago had been exhilarating and full of adrenaline, but his movements had been awkward and clumsy. He had pawed at me without any awareness or care for my pleasure. Pablo, on the other hand, managed to combine Santiago's coarseness with a keen sensitivity to the movements of my body.I opened my eyes and looked over at Roach, and further behind her to the rest of the girls. They all seemed to be staring wide-eyed at the display Pablo and I were putting on, though Roach only seemed impressed. And suddenly, even through my booze-tinted glasses, all of my usual hangups and fears came rushing back. What was I doing? Showing off like this in public? A man currently had his hand inside me for fuck's sake. And people were watching! What if my parents came downstairs? What if Coach K did? What on earth were my teammates going to say tomorrow if I let this go on any further?I tensed up a little, making eye contact with Roach again. She gave me an encouraging nod, making a crude gesture with her fist up near her mouth, mimicking a blowjob while raising her eyebrows at me. I let my attention return to Pablo, allowing my hands to slide down to the buckle of his pants. I whispered to him, "Te quiero chupar," which was my best guess at how to tell a guy I wanted to suck his dick.He took a deep breath as he nodded and started groping my tits while I fumbled with his belt. Finally, I pulled the belt through the loop and unbuttoned his jeans. I felt the heat of his throbbing cock waiting below, and I dropped to my knees in front of him. Eye level with his crotch, I slowly unzipped his jeans and pulled his stiff cock out from inside his underwear.Another first. I had seen Santiago's cock, and even carefully watched him as he pumped himself to climax, but this brought a whole new meaning to face to face. I stared at it for a moment before I acted, noting that it seemed slightly smaller than Santiago's, but Pablo was having none of my hesitation. He grabbed my right hand with his left and placed it along his shaft. At the same time, his right hand moved to the back of my head, pressing my face closer to his twitching cock.I opened my mouth to lick the tip, but as soon as my tongue made contact, Pablo started softly thrusting. Apparently he didn't want a gentle, sensual blowjob from an inexperienced virgin who was trying to take her time. He wanted to fuck my mouth.I tried to relax my jaw and let him do the work, because honestly there wasn't much I could do. He kept his hand around mine, forcing my grip to tighten around the shaft as he thrust in and out of my waiting mouth. It was rougher than I was expecting, and the tip of his cock kept hitting the soft palate in the back of my mouth. I found myself thankful that his dick was such a modest size.Pablo was getting closer and closer to the back of my throat as his thrusts increased in intensity. I could hear the wet sounds of my gag reflex starting to engage, and I started to worry that we were being too loud. Surely the entire hotel could hear us. What if my parents heard us?! I tried to use my hands more, so that he wouldn't make so much noise in my throat, but that only spurred him further.He started to whimper as his thrusts got faster and deeper. I could barely breathe, but I was lost in the ecstasy of knowing that I was doing this so publicly. I was giving some guy I had never met a blowjob in public. Not only that, with other people actively watching. I felt my clit spasm at the thought, prodded further by the noises Pablo was making up above. I wanted to touch myself, but with Pablo thrusting away I wasn't able to.Suddenly, with a groan, Pablo grabbed my head with both hands and pushed himself into me completely. He held me there so firmly that my panic reflex took over and I started to try to squirm free, but his grip was too strong. I felt his cock swell up as his motion paused for a moment, and then I felt his cock start to rhythmically contract as he continued to fuck my face. I felt a sudden gush of thick fluid spurt against back of my throat. My eyes teared up as he rode my face to completion, his cock pulsing as more and more cum flooded into my mouth.Pablo gave my mouth one final deep thrust before he pulled out of me with a popping noise, leaving me to slump over onto all fours as I let the copious amounts of his semen cascade out of my mouth onto the hotel carpet.I choked and gagged a couple of times as I regained my balance, propping myself back up to my knees. I glanced up to see Pablo stuffing his flaccid dick back into his pants and making himself look presentable again. He reached down and cupped my chin with one hand as he kissed my forehead. "Encantadora," he said as he stared into my eyes. He played with my hair for a second, and then walked away toward the bathrooms, leaving me on the floor behind the desk.I could barely focus on anything. I felt like my world was spinning. I was proud of myself, and still incredibly turned on, but I also felt kind of sick and numb. I could feel the years of shame and guilt closing in around me, my mother's voice echoing in my mind as I imagined what she would say if she saw me like this."--Quinn! You still in there?" Roach's voice cut through my thoughts as I realized she had been talking to me. I shook my head as I looked over toward her. "Hey, dude, you took that like a champ!" she said with a mixture of sympathy and admiration. "I don't think Truth or Dare usually has a winner, but I'm pretty sure you just won anyway. Come on, let's get you back up to the room and cleaned up."The rest of the girls huddled around me, most of them still tipsy and gregarious. They were too far away to get a good look at what had gone on behind the front desk, but they knew I had fulfilled the dare, and they were over the moon about it. Lara and Sophie took turns pestering me about what it had been like.Kaitlyn and Jessie were a bit more subdued, though Kaitlyn was laughing and teasing along with the rest of them. Jessie looked a bit distant, though. Melancholy. I was too overwhelmed with adulation and still trying to figure out how I felt about the entire evening's events to ask her about it, but I made a mental note to check in with her the next day. Above all else, I didn't want Jessie to be sad.We made our way back up to our room, and Sophie and Lara finally left and went back to theirs for the night. Roach was unusually tender with me as we settled in. I think she could tell that I was still in a bit of a daze. She helped me take a shower, and braided my hair as we all curled up together on one of the double beds to watch a movie.All exhausted, one by one we fell asleep in our cuddle puddle. I was the last one to fall asleep, my thoughts lingering on how wonderful it felt to be so close to my friends.End of Part 2[To be continued]Author's Note: Thanks for reading!

My contact information is available in my bio. <|endoftext|> It seemed that my impulsive proclamation had successfully redirected the entire group's attention from Kaitlyn over to myself, and I was absolutely loving it. Growing up as the smart, quiet kid I had really never experienced true peer pressure. And my soccer teammates were more than willing to provide it at this moment.As their excitement started to abate, Roach got back down to business. "Okay, Virgin," she said conspiratorially. "When we were down there, there was just the one guy manning the front desk. He definitely saw us streaking, and we didn't get in trouble, so we know he's willing to look past at least some stuff. I think it's likely that he enjoyed the show," she said with a wicked smile. "So he's probably already... ready for you," she finished.I could feel my heart in my throat as it hit me that I was actually about to go seduce a grown adult man. This wasn't like that thing with Santiago. That had happened more or less organically. Yeah, I had gone out with the intention of having some kind of wild experience, but it had been a vague sense of rebellion, and the decision to go to that park had been just as much Santiago's idea as mine. This was different. I was going to be literally trying to give this guy a blow job. Shit! A blow job! I'd never given anyone a blow job before! What if I sucked at it? What if it tasted terrible? Was he going to cum in my mouth? Is that safe? Should he wear a condom for a blow job?The thoughts started spiraling out of control and I was reeling from the attention, to the point where my eyes must have looked like a deer in headlights.Jessie seemed to notice that I was feeling a bit overwhelmed and she scooted over to me, placing her hand between my shoulder blades as she rubbed my back. "You don't have to do this, you know," she said. "You don't have to prove anything to us."Hearing Jessie's kind words calmed my racing thoughts and eased the building panic within me. I looked at her and remembered why I had volunteered in the first place. So that it wasn't Kaitlyn blowing a random dude while Jessie sat up here heartbroken and imagining her crush with a dick in her mouth. My resolve came back, along with a healthy dose of excitement at the idea of giving my first blow job."I know," I responded firmly, finally settling down with a smile. "I want to!"The rest of the girls cheered at that, and Jessie seemed satisfied enough with my response. They all quickly decided to give me an impromptu makeover to make me look as slutty as possible. Which basically just consisted of Roach slathering on eye shadow and lip gloss, while Sophie mussed my hair. They decided I couldn't go down there in my pajama pants and t-shirt, so they gathered the sluttiest clothes everyone had brought to find me an outfit.It ended up being a shiny bodycon dress of Lara's. I had always had an athletic build, which meant I was never super skinny. So I was shocked that Lara's dress would fit me, but it was made of stretchy material, so it turned out to be no problem. Except that on me it was so short that the dimples below my ass cheeks were visible. They insisted that I not wear any panties, "just in case". Kaitlyn lent me some heels she had brought, and I was ready to go.I glanced in the mirror and almost didn't recognize myself. The outermost layer of my naturally chestnut brown hair was bleached almost entirely blonde because of all the time I'd spent in the sun over the past week, and my skin was several shades darker than usual. Combined with the outfit, I looked easily 20 years old. I'd never worn anything quite like that dress before, either. It hugged every curve, curves I hadn't realized I had. I had hips, apparently.The team seemed pleased with the results as well. Roach whistled at me and made me do a spin in front of the rest of the girls, and I briefly caught Jessie's eyes flitting down over my body as I turned back around, her head cocked ever so slightly. That sent a tingle through me as I realized that Jessie had been checking me out. I felt my face flush as her eyes lifted back up to meet mine. But rather than displaying any embarrassment, she just raised her eyebrows at me and smiled."Okay," Roach said, pulling my attention away from Jessie. "I think you're ready.""Oh, wait," I objected, "What if he says no?"Roach laughed at that. "He's not gonna say no," she replied with confidence, "Not when the girl offering looks like that. But I'll tell you what: if you actually offer the dude a blowjob, like really try, and he still says no, then you'll have completed the dare." Roach paused briefly, thinking. "But if he says yes... and he will, you have to actually do it!" she added emphatically.I nodded in acknowledgment, feeling the rush of adrenaline course through my body again, and an aching sensation building between my legs.The girls and I made our way down to the lobby. It was late enough that the rest of the guests had all gone to bed, and Roach had been right about there only being a single guy manning the front desk.As soon as we saw him, Roach took charge. She told the rest of the team to sit down on the couches nearby to watch, while she led me over to the front desk. Roach marched us right up to the manager, whose name tag told me his name was Pablo, and practically shoved me toward him.Pablo seemed to be about 40. He was kind of short, and a little old for my eighteen-year old tastes, but handsome enough for his age. He looked over at the two of us, glancing behind us as he noticed the gaggle of four other giggling teenagers clearly watching from the couches. I noticed his eyes linger on my bare thighs as he gave me a once-over.My worries that he wouldn't be interested in me started to fade as I watched his tongue subtly move across his teeth as he continued to undress me with his eyes. I bit my lip as my own arousal swelled at the thought of him admiring and lusting after my body. Adrenaline and determination fueled my movements as I stood closer to him, allowing my hand to brush across his bicep as I stared up at him demurely.I couldn't help myself from continuing to bite my lower lip in a pout as I let my eyelids flutter. I felt a surge of boldness I'd never felt before, and allowed myself to speak.Spanish words flowed out of me with ease, with that classic false sense of fluency that comes with a bit too much alcohol. I'm sure the sentences that came out were nowhere close to fully grammatical, but Pablo didn't seem to care. I told him my name. I told him I thought he was handsome. I asked him if he thought I was pretty. With each sentence, the movements of my hand on his arm got a little more fluid, a little more confident, and Pablo seemed to be growing more comfortable with the entire situation.His eyes dropped to my chest when I asked him if he found me pretty. It was Pablo's turn to bite his lip as he nodded firmly, clearly happy to continue the line of questioning. I moved in a little closer, letting my hand wander across Pablo's chest and stomach. "Quieres tocarme?" I asked sweetly, nodding down to my breasts.Pablo let out a grunt of affirmation as his right hand reached up to cup my breast. Before I knew it, I felt his other hand grab my ass, pulling me firmly against his midsection. Immediately I could feel his erection pressing against my belly. I closed my eyes in a grimace as I felt my own body respond to his. Flashes of Santiago's swollen member flooded through my mind. How desperately I wanted that thick cock inside me. My pussy spasmed of its own accord as Pablo shoved his tongue into my mouth in a wet, aggressive kiss. I felt his hand move down from my breast and slide between my legs, as he started to kiss the side of my face and all along my neck.Since my friends had convinced me not to wear underwear, Pablo's hand immediately found my slit, now slick and wet with juices. A soft moan escaped my lips as his rough fingers explored my pussy lips and his teeth scraped along the soft skin of my throat. He clearly knew his way around the female body, and I found myself gasping with pleasure as he fondled me. He groaned with eagerness as he slipped his index finger inside me, grinding his thumb across my clit as he did so.I had never experienced pleasure like this with another person. My excursion with Santiago had been exhilarating and full of adrenaline, but his movements had been awkward and clumsy. He had pawed at me without any awareness or care for my pleasure. Pablo, on the other hand, managed to combine Santiago's coarseness with a keen sensitivity to the movements of my body.I opened my eyes and looked over at Roach, and further behind her to the rest of the girls. They all seemed to be staring wide-eyed at the display Pablo and I were putting on, though Roach only seemed impressed. And suddenly, even through my booze-tinted glasses, all of my usual hangups and fears came rushing back. What was I doing? Showing off like this in public? A man currently had his hand inside me for fuck's sake. And people were watching! What if my parents came downstairs? What if Coach K did? What on earth were my teammates going to say tomorrow if I let this go on any further?I tensed up a little, making eye contact with Roach again. She gave me an encouraging nod, making a crude gesture with her fist up near her mouth, mimicking a blowjob while raising her eyebrows at me. I let my attention return to Pablo, allowing my hands to slide down to the buckle of his pants. I whispered to him, "Te quiero chupar," which was my best guess at how to tell a guy I wanted to suck his dick.He took a deep breath as he nodded and started groping my tits while I fumbled with his belt. Finally, I pulled the belt through the loop and unbuttoned his jeans. I felt the heat of his throbbing cock waiting below, and I dropped to my knees in front of him. Eye level with his crotch, I slowly unzipped his jeans and pulled his stiff cock out from inside his underwear.Another first. I had seen Santiago's cock, and even carefully watched him as he pumped himself to climax, but this brought a whole new meaning to face to face. I stared at it for a moment before I acted, noting that it seemed slightly smaller than Santiago's, but Pablo was having none of my hesitation. He grabbed my right hand with his left and placed it along his shaft. At the same time, his right hand moved to the back of my head, pressing my face closer to his twitching cock.I opened my mouth to lick the tip, but as soon as my tongue made contact, Pablo started softly thrusting. Apparently he didn't want a gentle, sensual blowjob from an inexperienced virgin who was trying to take her time. He wanted to fuck my mouth.I tried to relax my jaw and let him do the work, because honestly there wasn't much I could do. He kept his hand around mine, forcing my grip to tighten around the shaft as he thrust in and out of my waiting mouth. It was rougher than I was expecting, and the tip of his cock kept hitting the soft palate in the back of my mouth. I found myself thankful that his dick was such a modest size.Pablo was getting closer and closer to the back of my throat as his thrusts increased in intensity. I could hear the wet sounds of my gag reflex starting to engage, and I started to worry that we were being too loud. Surely the entire hotel could hear us. What if my parents heard us?! I tried to use my hands more, so that he wouldn't make so much noise in my throat, but that only spurred him further.He started to whimper as his thrusts got faster and deeper. I could barely breathe, but I was lost in the ecstasy of knowing that I was doing this so publicly. I was giving some guy I had never met a blowjob in public. Not only that, with other people actively watching. I felt my clit spasm at the thought, prodded further by the noises Pablo was making up above. I wanted to touch myself, but with Pablo thrusting away I wasn't able to.Suddenly, with a groan, Pablo grabbed my head with both hands and pushed himself into me completely. He held me there so firmly that my panic reflex took over and I started to try to squirm free, but his grip was too strong. I felt his cock swell up as his motion paused for a moment, and then I felt his cock start to rhythmically contract as he continued to fuck my face. I felt a sudden gush of thick fluid spurt against back of my throat. My eyes teared up as he rode my face to completion, his cock pulsing as more and more cum flooded into my mouth.Pablo gave my mouth one final deep thrust before he pulled out of me with a popping noise, leaving me to slump over onto all fours as I let the copious amounts of his semen cascade out of my mouth onto the hotel carpet.I choked and gagged a couple of times as I regained my balance, propping myself back up to my knees. I glanced up to see Pablo stuffing his flaccid dick back into his pants and making himself look presentable again. He reached down and cupped my chin with one hand as he kissed my forehead. "Encantadora," he said as he stared into my eyes. He played with my hair for a second, and then walked away toward the bathrooms, leaving me on the floor behind the desk.I could barely focus on anything. I felt like my world was spinning. I was proud of myself, and still incredibly turned on, but I also felt kind of sick and numb. I could feel the years of shame and guilt closing in around me, my mother's voice echoing in my mind as I imagined what she would say if she saw me like this."--Quinn! You still in there?" Roach's voice cut through my thoughts as I realized she had been talking to me. I shook my head as I looked over toward her. "Hey, dude, you took that like a champ!" she said with a mixture of sympathy and admiration. "I don't think Truth or Dare usually has a winner, but I'm pretty sure you just won anyway.
