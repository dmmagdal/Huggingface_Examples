<|startoftext|><|title|>Eighteen Ch. 11 <|tags|>Tags: romance, novel, 18 year old <|story|>Chapter 11 -- ReconciliationSunday, January 17thIn the car, I take Christina's hand and ask, "Nicole understands this isn't a love triangle, right?""Yeah. Though, I think she wishes it was.""What about you?""Nicole is my best friend. We've learned we can sexually satisfy each other, and I really enjoy that, but she doesn't fulfill me emotionally. What we do in bed stems from lust but not love.""I can understand lusting after her," I jest, and Christina promptly punches my arm.When we arrive at my apartment, we get the mail, go upstairs, and then collect the dirty laundry. After sorting it, we take it downstairs to the laundry room and stick it in the washers. After going back upstairs, we crank some motivating music on the stereo and go about cleaning the apartment. My dad gets home just as we finish putting the washed laundry away. He looks exhausted."Hey, Christina," he says. "How are you? How's this boy of mine treating you?""I'm doing great, sir. Tom is incredible. He treats me like a queen.""You feeling okay, Dad?""Sure...too many parties and too few hours to have them in," he says. Then, looking at his watch, he asks, "What are you two doing for dinner?""We haven't talked about it," I answer."You guys want to go out for some Italian food?" he asks.I look at Christina, and she nods, so I answer, "Sure."He says he's buying, and I'm good with that. It's been a while since I've spent any real time with my dad, so sitting there with him and Christina is a treat. He rattles off his weekend events and some of the people he partied with and met. I recognize some of the names because they're celebrities. When we get back home, he announces that he's going to bed as he goes into his room and shuts the door."Your dad parties with all those people? I mean, some of them are pretty famous.""I'm sure he does; he knows a lot of people." I pause before continuing, "When we lived at the beach, there was a porn model that came to one of their parties.""You mean, like, one of those girls that pose in those magazines?""Exactly." I don't think it's a good idea to tell her how I joined in, so I leave that part to myself.Plopping down on the couch, Christina follows as she lands on my lap. It's nice to sit quietly and relax from our busy weekend.My feet are on the table while I contemplate our relationship and how it's evolved. I begin to wonder if we're heading down a dangerous road. Christina asks what I'm thinking, so I lay it out for her as plain as possible."So, you think we should restrict sex to the two of us?" she asks."I didn't say that. I'm just afraid that if we keep doing what we're doing, someone will get hurt. It may get confusing to know if we're feeling love or something else. Look at my dad," I pause, "he doesn't care who he sleeps with. He has or had...I have no idea now, a girlfriend whom he broke up with because of stuff like this. I don't want that to happen to us. I don't want us to get emotionally lost and have our house of cards crash before we realize it. I don't want our love to drift away or Nicole to get hurt because we've forgotten what we're doing."I'm not making any demands or asking you to do something you don't want to. I love you, and I don't want to take a chance of that being ruined." I give her a gentle squeeze and pull her closer to me as I rest my head on her shoulder.Christina lets out a sigh and says, "I've discovered a side of me that I didn't know existed until a couple of weeks ago. I'm not sure I'm ready to give it up right at the moment it's blossomed.""I can understand that.""But you're asking me to give it up anyway?" she half states and half asks."No. No, I'm not. I'm just asking that we be aware of the dangers and keep our heads clear about what we want in the long run."There's silence for a couple minutes before she asks, "What do you want in the long run?"Whoa...that's a loaded question! Do I really want to answer that? I slide her off my lap and turn sideways to look at her as I fold a leg under me. Resting my arm on the back of the couch, I lock my eyes onto hers. Her deep blue orbs sink into my soul, and I'm not really sure I should divulge my inner thoughts. I want honesty in our relationship, and she's kept her part of that bargain, so I need to be honest with her as uncomfortable as it is."The long run?" I pause and take a deep breath and then let it out slowly, "I don't want to...uh...can't...." I take another deep breath. Oh boy...I don't know how well she will take this...here goes nothing, "see my future without you. I want you in my life forever. I want you beside me and with me, always."She leans back a little and asks, "Are you talking about marriage?""We're only eighteen. We're too young to talk about marriage, but after college and we have careers, if you still want me, yes. I'd love to start a family with you. You're my love and my light; you're kind, gentle, loving, strong, independent, and beautiful. You're the perfect woman for me.""Whoa...." She put her hands up in front of her with her palms facing me, and there's another long pause before she says, "That's pretty scary to think about right now. We haven't known each other very long. Everything I do know about you, I love. You're the type of man I've dreamt about since I was a little girl." She pauses again, "How about this...let's not talk about marriage or children. Let's continue to get to know each other. As far as I'm concerned, you're the only guy I want to be with and the only one I see as a partner in my future, but we have a long way to go before that becomes a reality. When we're older, we can come back to this and discuss being a family, but for now, let's enjoy being teenagers and having fun. Deal?"It's nice to know where she's at mentally, and these are terms I can live with. So now I know where I stand with her."Deal. Ready to hit the hay?""More than," she replies. "It's been a fun but long weekend, and it'll be nice to just sleep."We stand and walk towards my room when we hear some loud noises outside. We look at each other because it sounds like someone's running up the stairs, and then there's a banging on my door. I open it and find Jesse standing there crying with a panicked look on her face.I pull her inside because I hear someone else running up the stairs, yelling at her. She turns around and gets behind me, bracing herself against my back like she's hiding from a monster. Looking out the door, I see the guy she was with at the library the first day I met her. He's storming his way towards me. I quickly ask Christina to call the police and for both of them to get in my room and shut the door."Block it, and don't let anyone in," I instruct.She grabs Jesse, calls 9-1-1 and then scurries to my room. I'm blocking the entrance as the guy tries to go through me, but I stiff-arm him to stop him outside. He leans back to take a swing at me, but when his fist comes forward, I grab his wrist and bring it down and behind his back, turning him around. Next, I kick him behind his knees, making them collapse, and push him down to the ground, putting my knee on his back. He struggles, and I twist his arm violently."Calm down, or I'll break your arm," I threaten."You fucking asshole, get off me. This is between me and Jesse," he yells."You made this between you and me when you took a swing at me. Now settle down, or I'll break your fuckin' arm."He struggles more, so I push my knee into his lower back, tighten my grip on his arm, and force his fist into the back of his neck. The police pull up, and two officers run up the stairs to meet us. The female officer tells me to get off him and asks what the fight is all about, so I tell her as I let go of him and stand up.Christina and Jesse emerge from the back room, and she has a bruise on her cheek that I didn't see when she first came into the apartment. The male officer searches the guy and then takes Jesse into the kitchen to question her. He fills out a report while the other officer arrests the guy. The officer forcefully puts him against the wall, face first, takes one arm at a time, pulls them behind his back, cuffs him, and then walks him down the stairs to the police car.The officer with Jesse tries to reassure her that everything's alright and asks if she wants a ride home. She looks at me and then at Christina, so I offer to let her stay with us for the night. She relaxes a little, but I can tell she's still scared."When will Steve be able to make bail?" Jesse asks the officer."He'll probably be arraigned tomorrow, so that would be the earliest," he responds."What if he comes after me again?""Call 9-1-1 if you see him. I'm giving you an Emergency Protective Order, so he won't be allowed near you for a week." Finally, the officer gives her more instructions on protecting herself and some paperwork before he leaves.I get some ice for her cheek while Christina sits down with her to talk. Her breathing is more even now, but she's still shaking as Christina gingerly places the ice on the bruise."I'm glad I was home when you needed help," I tell Jesse. "How'd you know where I live?""I live a couple blocks over and have seen you go home a few times when I passed by," she replies.I look at Christina, and she shrugs. "What happened? Why did that guy beat you up and chase you?" Christina asks."Uhm...Steve wanted me to steal some money from the lady I live with, and I wouldn't do it.""He beat you up over that?" Christina asks."Yeah...well...he has a short temper. I'm done with him, though. I never want to see him again!" Jesse's a mess and looks like she's been rolling around in the dirt."Would you like a warm bath or shower to help you relax?" I offer."That'd be nice, but I don't have anything clean to put on afterward," she replies."We'll find something for you to wear tonight while I throw your clothes in the washer. Then they'll be clean for tomorrow. Is that okay?" I ask."Yes. Thank you," she says. "I really don't want to impose on you. It's just...I ran over here because you're the closest person I could think of that would help me.""It's not an imposition," I say. "Maybe a bit surprising but not an imposition. You'll be safe here tonight, and we can talk tomorrow about what to do down the road."Christina puts her arms around Jesse and leads her to the bathroom. She goes in with Jesse and comes out with her dirty clothes. I take them and a couple other things we hadn't washed down to the laundry room, and when I come back up, Christina's in my room looking through my drawers."Did you find anything for her to wear?" I ask."Yeah, I grabbed a t-shirt and a pair of your boxers, if that's okay.""That's fine. Whatever will help her feel comfortable.""Where are my panties you kept? She can wear those.""Third drawer down. What do you think will be the best sleeping arrangements?" I ask. "If my dad weren't home, I'd have her sleep in my bed, and we would sleep in his. I'm not sure about having her on the couch because it's not that comfortable. And what if my dad walks out of his room in the buff? I don't want to scare her.""I'm sure the couch will be fine. We can tell her about your dad, so she'll have a heads up."While grabbing some linens to put on the couch, Jesse comes out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel. She goes into my room with Christina to put on the clothes she pulled out for her. She looks better but still shook up.Putting some fresh ice in the baggy, I wrap it in a washcloth and hand it to Jesse as she sits on the couch. We tell her not to be startled if my dad wanders out of his room naked. Shock and apprehension invade her face. I suppose it's because of her experiences with her father. We assure her that he won't bother her and to just ignore him.I excuse myself to go downstairs and switch her laundry to the dryer. When I return, Christina and Jesse are they're involved in a conversation that I don't want to interrupt, so I go into the kitchen and get them some water for them. Jesse drinks hers in one gulp, so I get her some more."Christina, are you comfortable driving my car to school tomorrow?" I ask."Yeah, sure.""Okay. I'll walk, and then you guys can come later in my car."We talk some more until I go down to get Jesse's clothes. When I get back, she looks a bit calmer, so I ask if she'll be able to sleep, and she says she's not sure but that she'll try. So I take the cups into the kitchen and tell her to just ask if she needs anything.Christina and I take a quick shower, and when we come out, Jesse is fast asleep. I'm glad she feels secure after her traumatic experience. Christina and I go into my room, close the door, and crawl in bed. We take a deep breath and sigh at the same time as I hold her close, like I'm afraid she'll get away. I love having her next to me and turn to look at her. Our communal gazes lock, and we kiss gently.Christina puts her hand on my chest and says, "Makes the discussion we had earlier seem trivial, doesn't it?""Just a little," I reply. "I'm so glad you were here to help me handle this."I roll her onto her back as I lift myself onto my elbows to hover over her. Then, kissing her again, I lower my body and let my length nestle between her legs."I'm not in the mood for sex tonight," she says."That's okay, I'm not either. I'm just really, really, enjoying your company right now.""Then why are you getting hard?""Have you looked in the mirror lately?" I say. "No matter the circumstances, you're one sexy lady.""Do I have to put on some boxers and a t-shirt too?"I roll off her and gather her close to me and say, "It wouldn't help."She chuckles as she snuggles into me, and we fall asleep.Monday, January 18thMy watch alarm startles me awake, so I pull myself out of bed, dress, and go to the bathroom to clean up. I'm brushing my teeth when Dad walks in. I explain what happened after he went to bed and that Jesse is on the couch, Christina is in my bed, and they'll be up shortly to get ready for school. He tells me he'll be out the door before they get up and will try to not wake them. I thank him, go to my room and give Christina a kiss on the cheek. She sleepily acknowledges it, and I leave for practice.I walk to our usual table at lunchtime and see Christina, Nicole, and Jesse deep in conversation."Jesse won't tell me what happened to her face," Nicole pouts. "She just says she ran into a door.""Doors can be brutal," I say. "I hit one the other day and just about broke it."Jesse and Christina chuckle, but Nicole just shrugs and says she has some things to take care of as she excuses herself."Are you okay?" I ask Jesse."Yeah, it's a little sore," she says, touching her cheek. "Thank you again for last night. You guys are lifesavers, maybe literally.""I told you I'd be there for you if you needed me," I say. "And I meant it."Christina then says, "I asked Jesse to stay at my place, at least until my parents get home, and then we'll see from there.""What about the lady you're living with?" I ask Jesse."I called her, and she said it would be best if I'm not around until the dust settles. She doesn't want her kids in any danger.""Sounds smart," Christina says. "If you need to get some of your things, I'm sure Tom will let us borrow his car." She looks at me. "Won't you?""Of course," I say. "Just don't strand me here. Remember, I'm working all week and need my car after practice to get to and from work."***************I see Jim before my next class, and he asks if I have my tux yet. I entirely forgot and tell him that I don't know where to get it. He gives me the card of a place and says to do it soon before they run out. I mentally go over my schedule and decide that I don't have time this week, so it'll have to wait.By the time I get to my study period, practice, the weekend, the previous night, and school has taken a toll on me, so I go to the back and slump in a chair. I'm earnestly trying to stay awake when Jesse wanders back with a smile on her face."Can I sit next to you?" she asks."Of course. I prefer it when you sit next to me, so I don't have to look at you.""Excuse me?""You're distractingly beautiful. When you sit across from me, it makes it difficult to focus on my studies.""Even with this nasty bruise?""Even with that nasty bruise.""Hey bud, I'm going to narc on you if you keep hitting on me!""I'm not hitting on you!" I say defensively and then soften my tone, "I'm just stating a fact.""Okay, Don Juan...back to your books," she chortles as she sits down.I think that's the first time I've heard her crack a joke. It's pleasant to listen to her be light-hearted.I see movement out of the corner of my eye. Two guys in suits walk towards us, led by a school counselor.They stop at our table, look at Jesse, and ask, "Jennifer Thompson?"I'm about to tell them there's no Jennifer here when Jesse asks, "Who are you?"They identify themselves as detectives and say they need to interview her about what happened last night. I'm about to excuse myself when Jesse grabs my arm and asks me to stay."Who's this?" one of them asks. "Your boyfriend?""No, but he's my friend, and I'd like him to stay.""We were told there'd be a Tom Griffin back here too, is that you?" one of the detectives asks."Guilty as charged.""Careful how you use that phrase around us," the detective says sternly.They ask Jesse a bunch of questions, and I learn that she turned eighteen a month ago, and the guy they arrested is twenty-three. They inquire about her relationship with him and what caused the fight. Then they ask what happened to her face; she explains everything to them without any emotion, which I find odd considering how traumatic it was.The officers explain that because they've had sexual intercourse since she was sixteen, they're adding Statutory Rape to his charges, which will identify him as a sex offender. She shrugs and tells the officers that he deserves whatever he gets.They turn their attention to me and ask why I threatened to break Steve's arm. They remind me that I'm an adult and can be charged with Battery and maybe even Assault, which can send me to jail. Jesse looks worried and tells them that I was just trying to protect her from being beaten some more.The detective looks directly at me and says, "Tom, we'd like you to tell us what happened.""Well," I start, "I was about to go to bed when I heard some ruckus outside and then banging on my door. I opened it, and there's Jesse--""Who?" the detective interrupts."Jesse," I say as I point to her."My nickname," she explains.The officer writes something in his notepad and then looks back at me, so I continue, "She looked scared to death and asked for help. About that time, I heard someone else running up the stairs, yelling. My girlfriend was there, so I asked her to call you guys and for both of them to go into my room, shut the door, and not let anyone in. Steve came barreling around the corner and tried to run into my apartment. I stopped him, and when he took a swing at me, I put him on the ground with my knee on his back. I told him that I'd break his arm if he didn't calm down. That's about when the officers showed up and told me to get off him, which I did."The detectives look at each other and decide that what I did was self-defense and that they won't file charges against me. Looking at Jesse, I breathe a sigh of relief. Then, they tell Jesse the District Attorney's office will get a hold of her and that she'll need to testify in court. They go over her address and phone number to make sure the information they have is correct, but she explains that she's staying with friends for the time being and that school is probably the easiest way to find her. They ask about her home, and she explains to them about her mom and the situation with the lady she's living with. They take more notes and then thank us before leaving. "Jennifer?" I ask with a surprised look on my face."Yeah...don't call me that. It's too girly for me. My initials are J.S.T., so people started calling me Jesse, and it stuck. I like it better anyway.""Sorry," I say. "I like Jennifer; it suits you.""That's because you don't know me that well.""What does the S stand for?""That's privileged information...on a need-to-know basis only, and you, buddy, don't need to know!"The bell rings, so we leave the library and go on with our day. When school is over, I stash my books in my locker and meet Christina. For once, I'm there before her. She comes up behind me and puts her hands over my eyes. I spin around, grab her by the waist, and pull her into me as I give her a passionate kiss."What if that hadn't been me?" she frowns."Your soft hands and perfume gave you away, besides...nobody but you would do that to me.""Jesse and I are going to get some of her stuff and take it to my house. We'll pick you up from practice, okay?""Sounds good. Are you going to take me to work and pick me up there too?""If you want.""It's either that, or you'll need to get a ride home. I won't have time to take you home and get to work on time.""We'll drop you off and then pick you up after work.""What about tomorrow? How will you guys get to school?""Nicole says she'll take both of us."I look at Jesse, who's standing behind Christina, "Be careful of those two...they'll corrupt you."Jesse laughs. "Corrupt me? That I'd like to see."Another joke and a laugh. Nice! "Be careful of what you ask for," I tease.Christina gives me the stink eye, "I think it's you who corrupted us!"I point at myself with a mocking surprised look on my face and laugh, "Who me?"I kiss Christina, look over at Jesse, and say, "See ya' Jennifer, and remember, be careful of those two!"Christina's mouth drops open as she spins around and asks, "Jennifer?""Don't ask. Your boyfriend's a big tease."Christina laughs and winks at me, "Don't I know it!"I take a step to walk away, but Christina grabs my hand and pulls me back to her. She says, "I love you, stud muffin, and don't you ever forget it!" And we lock lips in a deep kiss.Jesse chuckles and says, "Stud muffin? Oh, please!"We all walk away laughing.At practice, we finish our laps and are working on our entrances off the blocks when my teammate, Mark, lets out a low whistle. I look at him as he points at two girls walking into the pool area, where they climb into the bleachers and sit down.He looks at me and says, "Now those are some fine-looking ladies."I give him a glare, "Careful, that's my girlfriend you're talking about.""Which one?""The one on the right.""You're a lucky guy.""Luck has nothing to do with it," I say frankly.After practice, I come out of the locker room with Mark following me, but he walks away when he sees the girls aren't interested in him. We then get in my car, and they drop me off at work."I'm off at ten-thirty."Christina winks at me, "I'll be here, and if you're lucky, you'll get off at eleven-thirty too."***************I forget about everything but the work I have to do until my shift ends. Christina's sitting in the driver's seat of my car, alone, waiting for me when I walk out of the store."Where's Jesse?""With Nicole," she replies. "Will you take me home?""Of course, I will," I answer."We'll need to drop by your place first," she says."Why?""Because you're spending the night with me. My parents come home tomorrow, and it's going to be a while before we get to spend another night together.""Who am I to argue? Home, James...I mean, Christina."We get to my place to find my dad chilling in his chair, and he greets us in his usual manner. I gather some clothes and the things I need for school the next day and start for the front door when he stops us."Where're you going, young man?""I'm spending the night at Christina's. I'll be home tomorrow, after work.""You haven't been spending much time in your own bed lately, guy.""After tonight, I will be. Christina's parents come home tomorrow.""You two're being careful, aren't you?""Very. We know we're young and have a lifetime ahead of us."He smiles and tells us to have a good time.When we get to Christina's, Nicole and Jesse are in the living room watching a movie. Christina tells me to put my stuff in her room and then come back down with them.I'm dead tired, and all I can think about is sleep. Christina's sitting on the far end of the couch, so I sit on her lap and rest my legs on Nicole and Jesse's thighs. Then, leaning my head into Christina's shoulder, I close my eyes and fall asleep. I wake up to my leg hairs being pulled; Nicole and Jesse want to get up, but I'm in the way. Christina's asleep but wakes up when I stand, so I take her by the hand and lift her to her feet."Let's go to bed, baby doll.""Okay, stud muffin, I'm all yours," she says in a sleepy voice.Jesse's face gets all tight, and asks Nicole, "Baby doll? Stud muffin? Are they always like this?"Nicole sticks her tongue out and puts her finger in her mouth as if to induce vomiting. "Sickeningly, yes. You'll get used to it," she teases.Jesse laughs. "Don't bet on it."It's great to see Jesse smile and laugh. She looks so much happier and relaxed than when I first met her.Nicole says she's going home, and Jesse is sleeping in the guest room across from Christina. I ask if the parent's bedroom has been checked to ensure everything's in order. Christina is convinced her parents won't notice that we've had a couple of romps between their sheets.We walk around the house, locking up and turning off the lights before going to her room and shutting the door. I ask her how it's going with Jesse, and she says it's okay."I'm going to ask my parents if Jesse can live here until the school year ends.""I hope they agree because that'd really help her out. Hey, do I need a shower?""Naw, you're fine."We get out of our clothes, and I drop onto Christina's bed, exhausted. Putting my arms around my angel, I pull her in tight for a kiss and then roll on top of her as I lift myself onto my elbows to examine her features.I kiss her again and say, "I love looking at you like this.""Why?""Because you're beautiful and remind me of all that's good in the world.""How so?""Wow, where do I start?""Anywhere you want.""Head to toe, your dark auburn hair that curls gently around your face. Your deep blue eyes that hypnotize me and remind me of a tropical ocean. Your arching eyebrows that I want to caress with my fingertips. Your little nose that I want to kiss all the time. Your rosy cheeks that make you look happy, and your earlobes that are perfect for nibbling--"She puts a finger on my lips to stop me. "Okay, never mind, we'll be here forever if you keep going on like this.""You asked. I haven't even gotten to your lips, shoulders, back, boobs, nipples, abdomen, belly button, ass, and legs. I can go on forever, and that doesn't even count all the personality traits that make you such a fabulous person.""Hmm...I've never had a guy feel about me the way you do.""They must've been blind, deaf, and dumb. Besides, they weren't right for you, I am."Christina smiles softly, and her eyes twinkle. "Make love to me...all night long."I lean down and kiss her again, long and hard. The love I have for her burns deep in my heart, and the lust I have for her makes my balls ache. She spreads her legs and presses her pussy against my cock. Christina's wet, wetter than I thought she'd be. I lean down and kiss her nipples, sucking on them and flicking them with my tongue. Continuing my journey, I kiss her stomach and nestle my face in her groin. She spreads her legs further, and I kiss her inner thighs. Reaching her labia, I grab it between my lips and suck. This gets a moan out of her, so I lick her pussy, my tongue spelling out her name.My lips try to reach her clit that's hidden under her hood, but I have to pull her skin back to expose it. After swiping her nub with my tongue, I put my lips around it and suck as I flick it with my tongue. While doing this, I slide two fingers into her and press up against her g-spot. My fingers fuck her while I'm sucking on her clit, and she comes.My face is sloppy with her nectar, and I slide back up and kiss her deeply. My cockhead touches against her pussy, and her hips rock, trying to get me inside of her, so I roll my hips to match her movements, searching for her opening. When I find it, she moans in my mouth, and I push in slowly.I'm barely inside her when we release our lips, and I kiss her neck. She tilts her head back to give me better access, so I move to her throat and lick the hollow of her neck. Then, lifting my head, I focus on her eyes while pushing my cock into her. Once I can't go any further, I start back out. She lets out another moan when I'm barely inside her. Her fingers dig into my ass and pull me down, so I thrust all the way into her again, hard. I stay still for a few seconds and then pull back out again, slowly. I repeat this while she accompanies her moans with other noises that let me know she's enjoying herself.Our pace increases, causing her covers to slip off, and she wraps her legs around me, urging me into her. My breathing becomes rapid as I stroke faster, so I inhale deeply and then let it out slowly. I keep breathing like this as I thrust and eventually become tuckered out, so I slow the pace to a nice rhythm. I keep this pattern going, having been close to coming so many times I can't count them."Are you ready?" I ask."Yes," she hisses.I speed up again until my balls tense, and the urge rises again. She's breathing hard, and there are beads of sweat forming on her forehead."Let me know when," I huff."Any...time...," she grunts.I can't hold back any longer and release my cum through my shaft, relieving the aching pressure in my balls. She locks her feet and holds me against her firmly, and it feels like an explosion as my body releases my hot cream. Wave after wave rushes through me, and she mixes her moans with some grunts and tenses up as she raises her hips against me, and her legs tremble.She moans some more before she relaxes, and her face brightens with a smile. Holding onto me tightly, she leans up and kisses me deeply. Her arms are around my neck as she releases her legs, and I drop to my side. Still holding onto me, we continue our deep kisses as I soften and slip out of her. Then, our lips part as we try to catch our breaths, and we search each other's eyes. She then quietly leans into me, nuzzling her nose into my neck, so I put my hand on the back of her head and hold her."That was fantastic," I say, exhaling heavily. "It was the best yet. I don't know how we'll top that.""Mmmm, uh-huh." She nods and leans back into me.Rolling onto my back, I pull her on top of me. She's limp, like a rag doll, and breathing heavily into my neck. Her tits push into my chest while she purrs into my ear. I spread my legs, dropping hers between mine, and wrap my heels around her, locking her against me. I hold her like this until her breathing quiets and she twitches. She fell asleep on me again! I let go of her and roll her onto her side and lie there drinking in her beauty before I pull the covers over us and eventually fall asleep too.Tuesday, January 19thAll too soon, my watch alarm goes off, and I know it's time to get up. But, I don't want to move. Christina has her back to me, and my cock is wedged in the cleft of her ass, which pushes back against me. My arms are wrapped around her, and my hands are cupping her breasts like a living bra. She stirs as I kiss her neck, and she rolls onto her back."Time to get up already?""For me, it is," I reply. "You can stay in bed.""Not this time."We sit up as I tell her I need to shower and leave, and she tells me that we'll shower together. I remind her that I don't have much time to get ready, and she promises we'll be quick.We're getting dressed when she leaves the room, and when she comes back a few minutes later, she tells me she's going with me and finishes dressing. I didn't know a woman could get ready that fast."What about Jesse? What about Nicole picking you up? What are you going to do while I'm swimming?" I ask."Geesh! So many questions. I spoke with Jesse, and she says she'll be fine by herself. She has a key and can lock up when Nicole comes to get her. I'm going to watch you and maybe do a little homework, but I'm not betting on it. Watching you swim in that Speedo will distract me too much, so I'll probably just watch you.""Okay then, let's get something to eat and get out of here."We go to the kitchen and make some toast and juice, and I have a bowl of cereal as well. We go back upstairs and brush our teeth before grabbing our things and leaving. She's true to her word; she sits there and watches me swim.Being in the pool early in the morning is therapeutic for me. The water gliding over my back as I cut through the turbulence awakens my senses. My hand entering the water at just the right angle and then catching it as I pull it under me gives me focus. Feeling my muscles tense against the resistance gives me energy. There's something about pulling myself through the water and striving to pull harder that gives me purpose and helps me relax.Every few strokes, when my arm is in the air, I turn my head to breathe. I blast the warmed water and carbon dioxide from my nose and take in life-giving oxygen to feed my lungs. When I turn my head in Christina's direction, I try to look at her through my fogged goggles but can't make her out. But I know she's there, and having her in the bleachers gives me the incentive to work harder because I don't want her to see my teammates outswim me.***************Meeting Christina after practice, she greets me with a warm hug and a passionate kiss. When she wraps her arms around my neck, we play a game of tonsil hockey. This is the proper way to start a day! Then, we walk, arm in arm, to class, with her head leaning against my shoulder.At lunchtime, I make my way to our table and see the girls sitting there talking and giggling. When I get to the table, someone makes a shushing sound, and they clam up."I don't want to know the topic of the day, do I?" I ask.Christina smiles and says, "It's you.""Yeah...I don't want to know. So, how are the three prettiest girls in the school doing this afternoon?"Jesse laughs. "See...I told you...Don Juan."Nicole pipes in, "No...lover boy."Christina smirks and says, "No...I told you, stud muffin."By the third remark, I'm beet red."Ohhh, and he gets embarrassed too," Jesse adds. "There's a bonus."I get up to leave, but Christina grabs me by the arm and tells me I'm not going anywhere. I explain that I'm too embarrassed to sit there and listen to them talk about me, but she tells me to lighten up and gives me a hug and kiss. So, I sit there and try to be quiet while they talk about the upcoming dance, Nicole's boyfriend, and who they're going to find to take Jesse to the Winter Formal."Wow, Jesse wants to go to the dance?" I ask, surprisingly."Not really. They're trying to use peer pressure to talk me into it," Jesse complains."I think I know someone that'd love to go with you if you don't mind going with a swimmer," I say."Hey, bud...you're going with me! Remember?" Christina demands."Not me, pookie bear." They giggle as I say that. "One of my teammates, Mark.""Really?" Jesse asks."Yeah. Really. When the two of you came to pick me up at practice the other day, I thought his eyes were going to pop out of his head.""Ohhh, someone likes Jesse, someone likes Jesse," Nicole says in a singsong voice."Come by after practice, and I'll introduce you if you want," I offer.I tell them that I've had enough of the girl talk and am going to my next class. I lean over, kiss Christina, and then say goodbye. The rest of my day goes pretty slowly. Jesse isn't in our study period, so I figure she has other business to take care of.Meeting Christina before my afternoon practice, I pick her up, swing her around, and pin her against the lockers before kissing her hard."I don't know whether to call you guys sappy or tell you to get a room," I hear Jesse say from a distance.We break our kiss, and I look her way. Christina grabs my chin and turns my face back to hers, and clamps onto my lips. We stay like that until we hear Jesse clear her throat behind us."Jesse, are you going to drop by my practice this afternoon?"She shakes her head and says, "I don't think so."Christina moves behind her and gives her a hug. "She'll be there."Jesse rolls her eyes and reluctantly agrees. I leave them and go to practice, looking forward to seeing Christina and Jesse afterward. <|endoftext|> "Jennifer?" I ask with a surprised look on my face."Yeah...don't call me that. It's too girly for me. My initials are J.S.T., so people started calling me Jesse, and it stuck. I like it better anyway.""Sorry," I say. "I like Jennifer; it suits you.""That's because you don't know me that well.""What does the S stand for?""That's privileged information...on a need-to-know basis only, and you, buddy, don't need to know!"The bell rings, so we leave the library and go on with our day. When school is over, I stash my books in my locker and meet Christina. For once, I'm there before her. She comes up behind me and puts her hands over my eyes. I spin around, grab her by the waist, and pull her into me as I give her a passionate kiss."What if that hadn't been me?" she frowns."Your soft hands and perfume gave you away, besides...nobody but you would do that to me.""Jesse and I are going to get some of her stuff and take it to my house. We'll pick you up from practice, okay?""Sounds good. Are you going to take me to work and pick me up there too?""If you want.""It's either that, or you'll need to get a ride home. I won't have time to take you home and get to work on time.""We'll drop you off and then pick you up after work.""What about tomorrow? How will you guys get to school?""Nicole says she'll take both of us."I look at Jesse, who's standing behind Christina, "Be careful of those two...they'll corrupt you."Jesse laughs. "Corrupt me? That I'd like to see."Another joke and a laugh. Nice! "Be careful of what you ask for," I tease.Christina gives me the stink eye, "I think it's you who corrupted us!"I point at myself with a mocking surprised look on my face and laugh, "Who me?"I kiss Christina, look over at Jesse, and say, "See ya' Jennifer, and remember, be careful of those two!"Christina's mouth drops open as she spins around and asks, "Jennifer?""Don't ask. Your boyfriend's a big tease."Christina laughs and winks at me, "Don't I know it!"I take a step to walk away, but Christina grabs my hand and pulls me back to her. She says, "I love you, stud muffin, and don't you ever forget it!" And we lock lips in a deep kiss.Jesse chuckles and says, "Stud muffin? Oh, please!"We all walk away laughing.At practice, we finish our laps and are working on our entrances off the blocks when my teammate, Mark, lets out a low whistle. I look at him as he points at two girls walking into the pool area, where they climb into the bleachers and sit down.He looks at me and says, "Now those are some fine-looking ladies."I give him a glare, "Careful, that's my girlfriend you're talking about.""Which one?""The one on the right.""You're a lucky guy.""Luck has nothing to do with it," I say frankly.After practice, I come out of the locker room with Mark following me, but he walks away when he sees the girls aren't interested in him. We then get in my car, and they drop me off at work."I'm off at ten-thirty."Christina winks at me, "I'll be here, and if you're lucky, you'll get off at eleven-thirty too."***************I forget about everything but the work I have to do until my shift ends. Christina's sitting in the driver's seat of my car, alone, waiting for me when I walk out of the store."Where's Jesse?""With Nicole," she replies. "Will you take me home?""Of course, I will," I answer."We'll need to drop by your place first," she says."Why?""Because you're spending the night with me. My parents come home tomorrow, and it's going to be a while before we get to spend another night together.""Who am I to argue? Home, James...I mean, Christina."We get to my place to find my dad chilling in his chair, and he greets us in his usual manner. I gather some clothes and the things I need for school the next day and start for the front door when he stops us."Where're you going, young man?""I'm spending the night at Christina's. I'll be home tomorrow, after work.""You haven't been spending much time in your own bed lately, guy.""After tonight, I will be. Christina's parents come home tomorrow.""You two're being careful, aren't you?""Very. We know we're young and have a lifetime ahead of us."He smiles and tells us to have a good time.When we get to Christina's, Nicole and Jesse are in the living room watching a movie. Christina tells me to put my stuff in her room and then come back down with them.I'm dead tired, and all I can think about is sleep. Christina's sitting on the far end of the couch, so I sit on her lap and rest my legs on Nicole and Jesse's thighs. Then, leaning my head into Christina's shoulder, I close my eyes and fall asleep. I wake up to my leg hairs being pulled; Nicole and Jesse want to get up, but I'm in the way. Christina's asleep but wakes up when I stand, so I take her by the hand and lift her to her feet."Let's go to bed, baby doll.""Okay, stud muffin, I'm all yours," she says in a sleepy voice.Jesse's face gets all tight, and asks Nicole, "Baby doll? Stud muffin? Are they always like this?"Nicole sticks her tongue out and puts her finger in her mouth as if to induce vomiting. "Sickeningly, yes. You'll get used to it," she teases.Jesse laughs. "Don't bet on it."It's great to see Jesse smile and laugh. She looks so much happier and relaxed than when I first met her.Nicole says she's going home, and Jesse is sleeping in the guest room across from Christina. I ask if the parent's bedroom has been checked to ensure everything's in order. Christina is convinced her parents won't notice that we've had a couple of romps between their sheets.We walk around the house, locking up and turning off the lights before going to her room and shutting the door. I ask her how it's going with Jesse, and she says it's okay."I'm going to ask my parents if Jesse can live here until the school year ends.""I hope they agree because that'd really help her out. Hey, do I need a shower?""Naw, you're fine."We get out of our clothes, and I drop onto Christina's bed, exhausted. Putting my arms around my angel, I pull her in tight for a kiss and then roll on top of her as I lift myself onto my elbows to examine her features.I kiss her again and say, "I love looking at you like this.""Why?""Because you're beautiful and remind me of all that's good in the world.""How so?""Wow, where do I start?""Anywhere you want.""Head to toe, your dark auburn hair that curls gently around your face. Your deep blue eyes that hypnotize me and remind me of a tropical ocean. Your arching eyebrows that I want to caress with my fingertips. Your little nose that I want to kiss all the time. Your rosy cheeks that make you look happy, and your earlobes that are perfect for nibbling--"She puts a finger on my lips to stop me. "Okay, never mind, we'll be here forever if you keep going on like this.""You asked. I haven't even gotten to your lips, shoulders, back, boobs, nipples, abdomen, belly button, ass, and legs. I can go on forever, and that doesn't even count all the personality traits that make you such a fabulous person.""Hmm...I've never had a guy feel about me the way you do.""They must've been blind, deaf, and dumb. Besides, they weren't right for you, I am."Christina smiles softly, and her eyes twinkle. "Make love to me...all night long."I lean down and kiss her again, long and hard. The love I have for her burns deep in my heart, and the lust I have for her makes my balls ache. She spreads her legs and presses her pussy against my cock. Christina's wet, wetter than I thought she'd be. I lean down and kiss her nipples, sucking on them and flicking them with my tongue. Continuing my journey, I kiss her stomach and nestle my face in her groin. She spreads her legs further, and I kiss her inner thighs. Reaching her labia, I grab it between my lips and suck. This gets a moan out of her, so I lick her pussy, my tongue spelling out her name.My lips try to reach her clit that's hidden under her hood, but I have to pull her skin back to expose it. After swiping her nub with my tongue, I put my lips around it and suck as I flick it with my tongue. While doing this, I slide two fingers into her and press up against her g-spot. My fingers fuck her while I'm sucking on her clit, and she comes.My face is sloppy with her nectar, and I slide back up and kiss her deeply. My cockhead touches against her pussy, and her hips rock, trying to get me inside of her, so I roll my hips to match her movements, searching for her opening. When I find it, she moans in my mouth, and I push in slowly.I'm barely inside her when we release our lips, and I kiss her neck. She tilts her head back to give me better access, so I move to her throat and lick the hollow of her neck. Then, lifting my head, I focus on her eyes while pushing my cock into her. Once I can't go any further, I start back out. She lets out another moan when I'm barely inside her. Her fingers dig into my ass and pull me down, so I thrust all the way into her again, hard. I stay still for a few seconds and then pull back out again, slowly. I repeat this while she accompanies her moans with other noises that let me know she's enjoying herself.Our pace increases, causing her covers to slip off, and she wraps her legs around me, urging me into her. My breathing becomes rapid as I stroke faster, so I inhale deeply and then let it out slowly. I keep breathing like this as I thrust and eventually become tuckered out, so I slow the pace to a nice rhythm. I keep this pattern going, having been close to coming so many times I can't count them."Are you ready?" I ask."Yes," she hisses.I speed up again until my balls tense, and the urge rises again. She's breathing hard, and there are beads of sweat forming on her forehead."Let me know when," I huff."Any...time...," she grunts.I can't hold back any longer and release my cum through my shaft, relieving the aching pressure in my balls. She locks her feet and holds me against her firmly, and it feels like an explosion as my body releases my hot cream. Wave after wave rushes through me, and she mixes her moans with some grunts and tenses up as she raises her hips against me, and her legs tremble.She moans some more before she relaxes, and her face brightens with a smile. Holding onto me tightly, she leans up and kisses me deeply. Her arms are around my neck as she releases her legs, and I drop to my side. Still holding onto me, we continue our deep kisses as I soften and slip out of her. Then, our lips part as we try to catch our breaths, and we search each other's eyes. She then quietly leans into me, nuzzling her nose into my neck, so I put my hand on the back of her head and hold her."That was fantastic," I say, exhaling heavily. "It was the best yet. I don't know how we'll top that.""Mmmm, uh-huh." She nods and leans back into me.Rolling onto my back, I pull her on top of me. She's limp, like a rag doll, and breathing heavily into my neck. Her tits push into my chest while she purrs into my ear. I spread my legs, dropping hers between mine, and wrap my heels around her, locking her against me. I hold her like this until her breathing quiets and she twitches. She fell asleep on me again! I let go of her and roll her onto her side and lie there drinking in her beauty before I pull the covers over us and eventually fall asleep too.Tuesday, January 19thAll too soon, my watch alarm goes off, and I know it's time to get up.
