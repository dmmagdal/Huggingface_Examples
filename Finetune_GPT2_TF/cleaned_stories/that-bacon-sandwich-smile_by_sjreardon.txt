All characters are 18 or over.-----Lucas came first, so Lucas went first. That's just the way it was. Lucas got the bikes and the boots and the jackets first, and I got them after he was done with them. Lucas got first say on which channel we might watch that night, what flavour ice-cream we'd eat that week, where both our toothbrushes went, which of our chores he would, or wouldn't, do. He also got dibs on any extras. If there was a chop sitting uneaten on the serving plate after dinner, it was offered to Lucas and then to me if - if - he didn't want it.I put up with that shit for sixteen and a half years until the glorious day he secured a cadetship on a farm all the way up near Gisborne, and finally fucking left. It was sooo much better with him gone. Not that Mum and Dad suddenly decided that I was actually their favourite son, or anything like that - but I moved up the pecking order on leftovers, I got the bedroom all to myself, and with Lucas unavailable, Warren, the station manager, started offering me the odd jobs around the place that he'd previously given to Lucas.To be clear, these were universally ratshit tasks, sufficiently bad that he preferred not to even ask a farmhand to do them. Take this and this and go unblock that culvert. Take the old quad bike and a trailer of stone chip and fill in the pot-holes on the main race. Take the knapsack sprayer and go spray gorse in the gullies, in the really steep places where the boom sprayer can't reach. And then do it again next weekend. And the one after that, and the one after that. You can stop when you run out of gullies...ha, ha, ha...But I was in, because unlike all my other sodding chores, these jobs paid.Then what happened - then what fucking happened? Three things happened. Lucas finished his cadetship, and one of the farmhands, Riley, met some chick online and got all involved, to the extent that he shifted up to Taranaki so they could be together, and Lucas heard about it and put in for Riley's job and of course he got it, so he came back.I couldn't believe it. Couldn't believe it. I mean, who does that? Who leaves home, gets qualified, applies for a job with their dad's boss, and then fucking moves back in with their parents? Somebody who knows he'll always be offered the last chop on the plate, I guess. For sure, I wasn't planning to do anything similar. When I left, I was leaving for good. I'd be a speck on the horizon inside of a minute, and a few seconds later, not even that.It was what I thought about while I was shovelling shingle or inching my way along precipitous slopes kitted up in spray gear - that this crap was my passport to my own life, this was me earning my way to freedom. Hopefully, by the time I finished school, I'd have enough saved to live on for a little while, until I could get the licenses I needed to drive the class of vehicle I wanted. That was the only reason I was finishing out school. You sure don't need higher education to be a truck-driver, but you can't even start the process until you've held a regular license for two whole years, and since you can't sit for that until you're sixteen...by the time I turned eighteen it was July, and I was over halfway through Year 13, and it seemed like I might as well just see it out. Also, I knew that if I attempted leaving school without a solid plan of what to immediately do next, Dad would interpret that as me sitting around with my thumb up my arse and find tasks for me. Unpaid ones.At least the work I was getting from Warren didn't evaporate when Lucas came back. He had real work now, and these cruddy little jobs were his leavings, his outgrown boots. So my stash of getting-out-of-here money kept building up, even if everything else had gone back to being shite, and then it got a serious boost in early October.There was some misunderstanding with the shearing contractors, and they ended up being booked for almost a month later than the usual dates, and then when they arrived, there'd been some other misunderstanding and they were short a rouseabout. I only got to know about it because there was a good old yelling match getting started by the yards as I was cycling past on my way to the main gate to catch the bus to school, and when Warren saw me he shouted at me to come over. So I did, and when I got within range he grabbed me by the arm and kinda shoved me forward."Here's your rouseabout," he hissed. Then, to me, "Unless you've got anything more important on, that is?"I shook my arm free. "No. I don't...I mean...I can help out.""What are you paying?" Warren demanded."Eighteen fifty," a guy with ginger dreads said. Actually they were more dags than dreads. Gross.Warren was unimpressed. "You think I was born yesterday, mate? Stop giving me the bloody run-around!"The dude shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot, before muttering, "Well okay, it's usually twenty-two fifty, but the thing is, Deeks is a known quantity...""Not right now he's not," Warren snapped. "So bloody reliable, he can't even manage to show up!" He turned to me. "Twenty-two fifty an hour - three full days. Think you're up for it?"Hell yes, I was up for it. "Sure," I nodded.Warren snapped his fingers. "Then go and take that bloody stupid tie off and hop back here on the double, so we can finally crack on with things!"Finally, I thought, as I got back on my bike. Finally. God, farmers. He was basically frothing at the mouth about how late they were running, and it was only twenty past seven...I was also a bit surprised he'd pushed for me to be paid more, seeing as eighteen fifty was more than he paid me to slave my guts out.When I 'finally' got back to the woolshed out of my school uniform and dressed for the job, it was twenty to eight and Warren was, if possible, even more twitchy than before, but once things got underway and he'd satisfied himself that it was all running smoothly, he thankfully fucked off to do other things, and the mood in the shed relaxed noticeably.Not that it slowed down...there was nothing complex about what I had to do, and it wasn't physically demanding either apart from all the bending over, but the pace...god. Of the two guys I was working with, one was very slightly faster than the other, which meant that some of the time they were nicely offset, and I could be pissing about separating the skirt and crutch wool for the first guy, brooming it out of the way while the second guy was working on the the back wool, the long strokes of the main fleece, then I could step over to guy number two, gather the fleece as it fell away, chuck it back toward one of the tables, do the skirt of his next fleece while guy one was doing the main strokes...but when they weren't offset? I just tried to fucking cope, tried not to feel bad about the fact that the other rousie was somehow managing three stands to my two...It was probably the overriding need to maintain pace that kept me from noticing that I was working in close proximity with five very fit singlet-wearing men. My head was spinning by the time we took a smoko break, but they were sweet as, entirely chill about life, the universe and everything in between, drinking tea and eating oranges and bananas and cold cheese toasties, smoking and joking. I had a banana, and drank some tea as well, but I would've liked a Red Bull. And a plan for how I was gonna get better at this, quickly.Warren had been so fucking sour about everything that morning that he never even told anyone my name, I found out. But one of them suddenly said;"He-ey, you're Lucas's little brother, aren't you? Um...Isaac."Fuck Lucas. Going about calling me Isaac. Fucker. I nodded. "Zac. Yeah."So they introduced themselves. The guys I was rousieing for were called Blake and Tahi, and they were apparently the only ones who used actual names. The others - the rousie was called 'Toots', the fleece-o was called 'Shagger', and the big guy with dags was called 'Cats' for some reason, while his two buddies were 'Noodle', who was at least quite skinny, and 'Panda', who, like Tahi, was MƒÅori - and had no kind of Panda thing going on at all that I could see...I think I was probably supposed to be pleased that they gave me a nickname. Probably it was meant to make me feel included or something. Yeah. Great. They called me 'Nipper'.The spell after smoko was better. I must've started to develop a rhythm. Or maybe I just managed to slot myself into the rhythm already going on, the surroundings sinking into my skin, permeating. There was the gentle clickety hum of the shears, the easy listening music playing on the radio, the stuffy sheepy atmosphere of the shed, warming up fast in the sun...and the men. The men, bent over, working away seamlessly, fluidly, at their almost ritualistic task, fortunately too focused to catch sight of me perving on them whenever I could spare a moment.I felt like I got the best deal in the world, being paid real money to hang out within spitting distance of the two guys I was rousieing for. I don't know if they were the fastest, but they were definitely the finest of the bunch. And Tahi was the finest of the pair. God, was he fine. He was so. fucking. hot. Even though I mostly couldn't see his face. But his arms, his hands, his shoulders...big but not huge, toned, so toned, everything working perfectly in unison, like a finely tuned machine. No, like a thoroughbred.He laughed a lot, I noticed at lunchtime. I mean, they all laughed a lot, but it seemed like Tahi laughed the loudest, the most. Or maybe it was just that I always heard it, when it was him. Maybe it was because it reverberated around inside me, lighting things up, when he laughed. Maybe he really did fill every space he was in, or maybe...maybe that was me.He sure as hell filled every space in my imagination that evening, lying in bed. I undressed him in my mind, I made him stretch, I made him pose, I made him flex, I objectified him in the worst possible way, while Lucas lay five feet away, playing Crossy Road with the fucking sound on...I fell asleep, and Tahi showed up to occupy that aspect of my consciousness as well. In my dream, I got sick of him trash-talking me - not that he'd done anything of the sort - and made a bet with him that I could get through a pen of ten hoggets faster than him. Of course, I had no idea what to do, and I was distracted by him working right next to me, so that I was still blundering around struggling to handle my first hogget as he pushed his last down the chute and remarked, 'Whoops. Looks like you lost'. Then his hands went to his fly as he said, 'On your knees, Nipper - time to pay up'. Yeah. No prizes for guessing the state of my boxers in the morning...The second day in the shed, I ached. I don't mean my balls, more...absolutely everything else. I hadn't especially felt like I'd been overexerting myself the previous day, but obviously I had. So once again, the first spell was tough, this time because I was uncramping, re-warming up. Once again, it got better later in the day, easier to handle. Once again, it got more sexual, more explicit, more x-rated in my mind...At the end of the day, while they were hanging about in a loose huddle, either sitting on the yard rails smoking or chatting with Lucas and the other farmhands as they got ready to swap out the afternoon's mob of sheep for tomorrow morning's, I noticed Tahi detach from the group and quietly slip away. Wanting to know what he was up to, I crept around the back of the woolshed so I had a better vantage point to see where he might be headed.He trotted about a hundred metres along the driveway, back toward the houses and quarters, then vaulted over the fence on the far side, clearly making for the bush. It was the only decent stand of forest left on the place and it was well preserved, thick with undergrowth, because it ran along the steep sides of a river that'd been the original water source for the homestead, so it'd always been fenced to keep stock from fouling it.I wondered what he was doing in there. My mind flipped immediately to the idea that he was looking for some cover, some privacy so he could have a little...personal time. He'd likely been on the road with these guys for almost two months, which I could see would get frustrating...despite that, I knew there were a hundred more likely explanations for taking a walk by yourself than wanting an alfresco wank, but I couldn't look at this guy without sex being at the forefront of my mind, overshadowing everything else. I wanted to follow him anyway. I wanted to know. I wanted to see.I didn't follow him. I'm not that stupid.Or, I dunno - maybe I am. Because when he broke off from the group the next day, I noticed a towel slung around his shoulders as he strode away, and everything clicked. I realised he must've been here previous seasons, or maybe for crutching, and know about the swimming hole. But he probably didn't know, or hadn't thought about, the fact that there was a bluff overlooking it...I followed him. Far enough behind that I wasn't obviously making for the bush until he was already in it and unable to feasibly look back, not so far behind that I'd arrive at my viewing platform after he was done - I knew he wouldn't be swimming for long at this time of year. The water in the river was probably only six or seven degrees. Very...um...refreshing.I reached my spot in time to see him. He was naked in the little pool at the foot of the falls, splashing about like an otter, coming up to gasp, going under again, silvery-quick. I couldn't make out much detail, just flashes of flanks and arms and face and skin, but it was enough...when he moved to the rocks at the side to pull on his clothes again, I leaned against a tree, tucked my t-shirt up, pushed the front of my pants down, shut my eyes and replayed the scene in my mind as I relaxed into stroking myself...that beautiful body of his, doing what came naturally, glorying in the simple fact of its existence..."If you want to make a habit of spying on people, then you're gonna need to get better at it."Oh my fucking GOD. I stood frozen, eyes still closed, just falling and falling in my head.I'd had my hand out of my pants in about a millionth of a second, the instant I heard the voice, but still I knew he saw. I knew it was him, and I knew he saw, and I knew he knew...what it was about.It's the end, I was thinking. It's the end of everything. He's gonna go straight and tell the others, hey, you wanna know what I just saw? And they're gonna tell Lucas, and he's gonna tell...everyone. And Dad. And Mum, and ohhhh, god..."For starters, don't do your creeping in bright colours," I heard him say. "That blue sticks out like a sore thumb in here. You wanna be in black or grey or brown, something like that. Y'know, like hunting gear."This wasn't...panning out quite like I'd imagined. I dared to open my eyes, peeked across at him standing there, regarding me from about five feet away.He just stared right back. He didn't look angry. He didn't sound angry either, when he started speaking again."I knew you were following," he told me in a quiet, steady voice. "I heard you, saw you. But seeing as you didn't come for a swim, I gotta figure you came for a show. Couldn't stay in too long for you, though - it was fuckin' cold. So did you get enough of an eyeful already, or do you need a close-up?"A close-up...what? Now I was terrified. I stopped mangling my lips with my teeth long enough to blurt, "I'm sorry...I'm sorry!" screwing my eyes shut once more."Who's asking for an apology?" I heard him say. "I mean, do I look bothered? Open your eyes, e hoa!"I opened them."Do I look bothered?" he prompted again.I couldn't understand it, but he didn't. I shook my head, and managed a tiny "No."I saw the corners of his mouth quirk as he breathed;"That's right. No." His hand wandered down to his crotch. "Was this what you were wanting to see? 'Cos you know...cold water...it was probably a sad kinda show. I can give you a repeat viewing...if you want."I couldn't say a word, couldn't move a muscle, nod, shake, back away...anything. I just stood there like a log of wood, like a fucking statue, as he slowly unzipped his fly, spread apart the flaps of black denim and exposed himself. He was commando. He was glorious. And he looked as if he could be...just a little bit...plumped up.The notion that he might possibly be even slightly into the fact that I was into him obliterated all the terror that was keeping me rigidly rooted to the spot. Instead everything melted and loosened. My whole body felt hot and liquid and drooly and my knees threatened to give out on me.I could probably have dragged myself away at that point, like some wounded animal, but I didn't. I stayed and stared and stared and stared, drinking in the sight of him. His dick gave a little pulse under my gaze, a tiny twitch, straightened fractionally, sat a little prouder. I tore my eyes away, looked up at his face. He was watching me. Of course he was."You want to touch it, don't you?" he breathed, and I didn't try to deny it. It wasn't really a question anyway. He knew.I took a step forward, and another, and another, stopping a pace or so away from him, reached out, timidly grazed the backs of my fingers along that beautiful dark smoothness, and it jumped again, stretched taller, tauter.I looked up at him. "Did you do that?""No," he told me, smiling. "You did that."So I did it some more, with increasing boldness and focus, and he grew to full hardness in my encircling palms. I kept my head bowed, watching my hands at work, one over another, as he thrust gently into them, seeing the weeping head of his dick briefly emerge only to be engulfed once more. Fuck, it was like there was a choir of angels in my head singing for all they were worth. I'd never felt so content, so present, so complete.He caught me a little by surprise when he reached out and manoeuvred my chin so I had to meet his eyes, and I actually quit my stroking. Taking hold of my lips between his thumb and forefinger, he sort of rolled them back and forth. That close to my nose, I got a hefty dose of the pungent scent of his hands, mostly a mixture of raw lanolin and swarfega, his day-job permanently embedded in his skin, and for the first time in my life I didn't mind the smell of sheep.He was still plying my lips, massaging them not altogether gently, as he murmured, "Hey, if you wanted to take this further, I wouldn't, y'know, have any objections...because these...what a beautiful pair you have on you, e hoa."I wanted to. Oh god, I wanted to. But I didn't know how.He let go when he saw I was trying to speak. "I haven't - I never..."He grinned at me. "There's a first time for everything, eh?" He had nice eyes. Really nice. Now I wanted to do it not just for myself, but for him.I frowned down at the ground around our feet, at the leaf litter. It was four or five inches deep in here and some kind of damp always, even in the summer, in the hot. No matter how much I wanted it, I wasn't going back up to the house with wet patches on the knees of my jeans.Tahi figured what I was thinking and tugged the towel off his shoulder, swiftly folding it into a pad, offering it to me. "That should do it."Yeah, I thought, taking it from him, that'll work. It was a little damp from drying him, but nothing compared to what would wick up from amongst those leaves. I knelt quickly down, and straightaway buried my face in his bush, to orient myself, buy some time, work out what I was meant to be doing here. He had a crotch smell...a quick dip in plain cold water had probably blunted it some, but not erased it. Sweat and work and man, but his skin was clean, cool and soft, delicate almost. Gorgeous. Mouth-watering.I was still kinda hesitant when I first took him in, but that lasted all of a second. I'd forgotten how sensitive your tongue is, how much you can feel, not just taste, with your mouth. So much contrast, so much everything. Mind-boggling. Up, and down, drooling everywhere, tight smooth skin in a long lap under my tongue when I relaxed it broad and flat, giving way to concertinaed folds under the head that I could riffle and burrow into when I tensed it to a point.He liked that, I could tell. I could tell, because I could feel everything, transmitting through, and I could not get enough of it. I soon sensed it coming to an end, though. He hadn't thrust into me initially, had been letting me explore in my own time, figure it out for myself, but he'd started to twitch his hips, to back-and-forth minimally, then less minimally. I just moulded myself to him like a limpet, bracing my hands on his thighs, and let him clasp my skull in his hands, get on with the doing while I revelled in the feeling, and in no time at all he was spurting into my mouth, I was swallowing him down, and it was done. We were done.I came back to earth with a cold hard thump. What now? What was he going to do? Call me a fag? Point and laugh? Tell his mates - my brother - that I sucked dick? Or just walk off and ignore me? I decided to walk off myself before I could find out, but as I was scrambling to my feet he caught my wrist, arrested me, made me look at him."That was sweet...fuckin' A," he breathed, leaning in, "and hey, if you think you might want more, you come and find me later. After dinner, alright?"I nodded blindly and stumbled away, too fogged with arousal shot through with fading stabs of panic - god, that could have gone so wrong - to give him an answer.It was all hell in the house when I got there. I couldn't risk a wank because Lucas was done for the day, and instead of sitting on his arse staring at his phone in the lounge, he was sitting on his arse staring at his phone in the bedroom, and the bathroom was right through the wall, and just...nah...Also I had no spare time, as I was angrily reminded by Mum. "Where the hell have you been, mister?""Went for a walk," I shrugged.She rounded on me. "A walk? And you thought the dogs and the chooks would just feed themselves, did you? Hop to it - it's almost dark!""You could've gotten Lucas to do it," I sulked, taking the dog roll out of the bottom drawer of the fridge."Lucas has been working all day," she snapped at me."Whereas I've just been batting my friggin' eyelashes and looking ornamental?" I enquired, angrily hacking off a couple of chunks.She held the vegetable peeler up underneath my nose. "Don't you talk to me like that, my boy!"I pushed it aside. "Alright, alright! I'm doing it, aren't I? Jesus god, I'm doing it!"Am I doing the other thing, though? I asked myself, out in the cool dusk, hosing out the dogs' bowls. Am I? Have I tried enough risky shit for today, or should I take what chances I can get, when I can get them?I knew what my answer was gonna be before dinner was through. Once his plate was clear, Lucas pushed back his chair and asked Dad for the key to the gun safe."Me 'n' some of those guys, we thought we'd go spotlighting down on the south flat - it's all clear of stock now."Dad handed it over. "Check it with Warren first. Remember, he's your employer. Anything goes wrong, it's on him.""Already did," Lucas assured him, sauntering away.Yes! I thought, something leaping in my chest. Yes! That's you out of the way, for hours and hours and hours. But will Tahi go out with you, or will he stay...for me? Only one way to find out...I cleared the table without being asked, dried the dishes without being reminded, getting back into the good books.Hanging the tea-towel back up, I said, "Mum, can I go up to the shearer's quarters? They have a playstation.""But they've gone out spotlighting," she countered."Nah, not all of them," I assured her.She squinted at me. "What makes you think they're going to want you up there, hanging about like a lost dog?""They said I could," I insisted, "they invited me! Mum! C'mon...they have a playstation!" Doing my best adolescent whining.She shook her head and laughed. "Okay. But don't outstay your welcome, and don't, don't, let them feed you anything stronger than beer. I really mean that, Isaac."I raised my hands in surrender. "Sure, sure, okay. I'll behave. I might just take a shower, before I head up there.""Good idea," her voice wafted after me down the hall, "you pretty much stink, right now."I felt some definite butterflies in my gut when I knocked on the door of the shearer's quarters, but they flew away the moment Tahi opened the door, leaned against the frame, and ran his eyes over me as his face slowly split into a smile. My pulse spiked that he was so obviously pleased to see me. Well, of course he was pleased. Me showing up meant he was gonna get off again.Then I noticed he was still part-way through his dinner...he had a bacon sandwich grasped in one hand. My eyes practically rolled back in my head.Holy shit, I thought, the only way you could possibly make this man any more irresistible would be to give him a bacon sandwich to hold, and here he is. Completely fucking perfect. I'd swallow it all, and then start on the fingers, and then...It seemed like he read my mind, because he slowly brought up his hand, twisted his wrist, held it out in front of my mouth. It looked pretty damn amazing - two fat slabs of white bread, turning translucent toward the centre where the butter had melted on contact with the shaggy ruffled dark pink strips of meat."Open up," he breathed.I did, and he pushed a corner in for me to bite off, winking, saying, "I'll just grab my swannie - be right with you," turning away to leave me drooling on the doorstep.I heard him, muffled, telling someone indoors, "Me an' the nipper might go see if we can catch up to those other tossers, alright? Ka kite, bro." He reappeared, shrugging into his Swanndri, jerking his head at me as he walked past, saying, "C'mon."We got in his ute, and he reached over toward me, the very last bite of sandwich held between thumb and forefinger. I saw the flash of white teeth...another one of those grins, even though I couldn't catch much other detail of his face in the low light. "Saved this for ya - thought that mouth of yours deserved a reward."I laughed and let him feed it to me, enjoying everything about the experience. As we rolled down the gravel driveway, he said, "Well, you're the one who knows your way around. Where can we head that's good and private, where those other guys most definitely aren't?""They went to the south flat," I told him. "So we should go the other way - turn left."As he drove, I tried to think of something, somewhere. Obviously there was a pretty low risk of running into random people out prowling, given we were on the middle of a farm in the middle of nowhere, but still...in some sense, the best way to not be seen was to head into the bush like earlier, except it'd be so dark right now under the canopy that you literally wouldn't be able to see a hand held up in front of your face. Then I had a brainwave, and directed him off the road, through a gate and up a shallow incline."There's a little hollow behind that stand of macrocarpas," I told him, as we lurched across the paddock. There were also a couple of concrete water-tanks and an old broken-down pump inside a crumbling lean-to, so we'd be sheltered on three sides.He nursed the ute up the last bit of slope and over the tiny crest, tucking it in behind the arc of trees, killing the lights, turning off the engine, leaving the key in the ignition.As we got out our respective doors, I heard him say, "This is a nice place."I'd never particularly thought about it before...little hollows are mostly just a pain in the arse when you're trying to move a mob of sheep."C'mere," he told me, and I padded over to stand next to his blurred outline, as he sat on the ute's lowered tailgate, staring toward the next slightly higher ridge, to the northeast. There was a band of cloud lying across the horizon, but above it the sky was clear, and there was a vague glow to the cloud's upper edge. The moon was rising behind, I realised - it'd probably be lighter in half an hour's time than now. It was nice. It was really nice. I was...kinda nervous about this whole thing...I could feel my heartbeat throbbing up in my throat, but all the same I knew I didn't want to be anywhere except here.Tahi reached out a hand and unzipped my hoodie, pushed it back off my shoulders, dropped it to one side on the ute's deck. He didn't say anything, so I didn't either. Instead, he took hold of my waist and manoeuvred me so I was standing in front of him, facing away. I felt his hands settle on my back, stilled for a moment, each side of my spine, warm in contrast to the evening air. Then he started to massage, walking his fingers up and down my backbone, digging in with thumbs under my shoulder-blades, gripping and rolling my trapezius muscles. Very quickly, I had way too much going on, lots of disjointed thoughts ricocheting around...oh my god, he's touching me, aaaaagh so good, he's a pro at this...shit, that hurts right there...oh fuck...touching mee...I leaned into him, melting under his kneading fingers, picturing his own back in my mind, how amazing it was to watch him at work, thinking too about this labour I'd been doing for only three days, that'd made me all inflamed and tender, while he was hefting around wooly carcasses that weighed about the same as a bag of concrete day in, day out, and it was all nothing to him...easy. At least, he made it look easy, he was so competent, so fluid and efficient with his movements. I wondered if the sheep felt his magic the same as I did when they got up close...the assurance hanging about him like an aura, and that's why they went all passive and slack, just like I had.Mostly had. There was one part of me that was a very long way from being passive or slack. He hadn't tried to explore anywhere near there, and I instinctively knew he wouldn't. I didn't mind - I was so keyed up at that point that there was a major risk I'd embarrass myself if he so much as grazed it. Even thinking that thought caused my balls to draw up, my dick to strain like it was trying to burst out of itself. I breathed, slow and steady, focusing on the knots his thumbs were working in my lumbar curve.He spoke, finally. "So, you came back."I nodded, swallowed...it made a kind of squinching sound in the stillness of the evening. "Uh-huh.""Guess that means you decided you did want more?"I just nodded again, feeling that throbbing in my throat quite distinctly now.He leaned forward a little, and I felt his breath against the back of my neck. "And what it is that you're wanting?" he prompted, very softly.I didn't say anything. I couldn't."You gone all shy on me?" he teased, running a fingernail up my spine, all the way to my neck, "You didn't seem so shy a coupla hours ago. Least, not once I got you started. Though you were a bit quiet at the beginning, now that I think of it, eh?"I stayed silent, motionless, as the finger traced down again, all the way, until it dipped slowly, purposefully, below the waistband of my jeans, lingering for a few seconds, before he removed it and said;"Fact is, I'd like to fuck you, but only if you're sure you're good with it. Otherwise, I'd definitely take another session with that mouth of yours, because that was also...a fine, fine thing." Hands on my hips now, he turned me around to face him again, raising my chin until I was looking at him. "So...whaddaya say? What'll it be? You gonna let me fuck you?"I got a huge surge of adrenaline through my body, terror and euphoria both spiking - it was like that moment the year before, when I'd been standing on the platform above the Kawarau Gorge, ankles bound together, attached to a bungee cord - the sudden sense of...shit just got real. I'd been hellishly scared looking down, but I hadn't regretted jumping, not even while I was still falling. I didn't think I'd regret this either, so I told him yes.He treated me to another ones of those smiles. "Okay," he murmured, "okay...now how 'bout you lose those jeans?"My heart hammered even more insistently at the base of my throat as I bent down to undo my boots, and I felt lightheaded when I came upright again to toe them off. He gestured at me, a rolling motion of his hands...continue, continue...I took a big gulping breath and pushed down my jeans. I'd decided to go commando too after my shower, for the secret thrill of it, and now it wasn't secret anymore. I covered myself with my hands.He snorted. "Hey, what's that all about? Lemme look! I think I can prolly handle it..."I didn't know why I didn't want him to see, given that he had to know I was hard, that I'd been that way, painfully so, since he'd forced that first chunk of bacon sandwich past my lips.The moon broke free of the cloud and washed everything with a milky light, and I saw that he was pouting playfully at me. "Bro, c'mon! I mean, I showed you mine..."That made me laugh, and suddenly everything was okay - the obstruction in my throat dissipated, and I took my hands away from my crotch, flung my arms wide, as if to say, 'ta-da!'His eyes ran over me briefly, then back to my face. "See?" he joked. "I didn't faint!"I twirled around on the spot like some fucking ballet dancer, and laughed some more, and some more. I couldn't stop. I was capering about barefooted in the dew, in the middle of a paddock, in the half-dark, wearing only a t-shirt and a hard-on, and I was about to give myself up in pretty much the most intimate way possible to someone I barely knew. It was utterly insane, and I absolutely didn't care...I'd never felt more alive.He slipped down off the ute's tailgate, pulling off his swanndri as he did, and beckoned me over, stood behind me, his body flush with mine and radiating heat. He wrapped me up, forearms across my front, trapping my arms by my sides, and began to flex his hips back and forth against my butt. I got that liquid sensation through my muscles that I'd felt earlier, the same wooziness in my head, and just let myself go to bathe in it.Before long, he broke the spell, his upper arm keeping me clamped while the lower one reached briefly between our bodies, and then his fly was undone again - I could feel the cold teeth of his out-turned zipper making a raspy track across each of my cheeks, and the compelling, urgent heat of his sturdy erection nestled between them, now catching, tugging on my skin as he started up his frotting once more. It was sensational. I let my head loll back against his shoulder as I shifted my hips side-to-side and ground back, seeking more contact."You like that, eh?" he growled gently, just above my ear.I tried to say, 'Uh-huh,' but it got mangled on the way out, and just ended up as 'uhhhhh...' a long breathy moan.He chuckled softly, and squeezed with his arms. "You done this before, bro?""Nuh-uh," I whispered, still moving in time with his slow hypnotic rhythm."You play with yourself at all? Toys, anything like that?"I shook my head vigorously. How could I have? I lived in a house that had one bathroom and zero lockable doors, and I shared a bedroom with my brother. Anything you couldn't do quickly in the shower, or subtly under the sheets once Lucas was snoring - you couldn't do at all."Alright," he breathed, "we'll take it nice and easy, then. Nice and easy. Plenty of time, after all."He released me to fold up his swanndri, laying my hoodie over it, making a sort of pillow on the ute's deck, then he shuffled me around until he had me arranged how he wanted, standing spread-legged and bent forward horizontal from the hips, my t-shirt pushed up around my armpits, my head laid on my folded arms, which were resting on the pile of clothing. I felt incredibly vulnerable, on display like that, knowing he was standing behind me, looking...planning. It was scary, but definitely a good kind of scary. I was still hard as a railway spike.He patted me on an arse-cheek. "Wait there, don't move," walking around to the front of the ute, opening the door to the cabin. He had a pot of something in his hand which he set down by my shoulder when he returned. It was obviously some kind of lube, because a few seconds later, I felt the tips of his fingers fan out on my cheeks, spreading me, as his thumbs gently massaged something around my hole. It was sensation overload...I bit my lip, closed my eyes, and panted.Then he slowly, smoothly, pushed one in, and I almost came on the spot. He paused for a bit, then withdrew, just as slow, until he'd exited me completely. Then he did it again. And again. And again. Although the physical feeling of having something foreign wedged inside me was...mostly just bizarre, I was madly in love with the idea of it. He's inside me, I kept telling myself, he's inside me. Actually inside me, ohhh god...He leaned all the way forward over me, thumb firmly plugged in, to whisper in my ear, "Shit, that feels good. I am so looking forward to this. You taking this okay?"I nodded, adding some vague noise of assent, and he peeled himself off me, saying, "Alright, let's move it up a notch."It was more of a step-change than a notch when he switched from the thumb to two fingers - they didn't just glide, he had to apply genuine pressure to break through the ring, and I felt a twinge that made my breath catch, a definite dull throb in its wake. But so far from putting me off, it sent the anticipation and euphoria I was already feeling soaring into some out-of-control spiral of craving. I was tripping plenty already, but I just. wanted. more.Slowly, slowly, he drew both fingers out again, and reached forward to fumble with the pot he'd put down beside me. I opened my eyes and saw that it was a tub of the grease he used for cleaning and lubricating his combs and blades. For some reason, the idea struck me as utterly hilarious. I tried not to laugh as he began working more of the stuff in and around my hole, but like always, holding it in made things worse, and I ended up consumed with giggling."Wassup?" Tahi asked me, as I tailed off. "I never heard of anybody being ticklish back here."That got me going all over again, and he leant forward onto me, like he had before, to speak in my ear, but closer this time, stilling my shudders with his weight as I felt his dick lodge itself along the valley of my crack, thrumming with presence, with promise."You're freaking out a little bit, aren't you?" he breathed. "Keep it together here, e tama. It's the first time, so yeah...it probably is gonna hurt some at the beginning, but it'll sort itself out real quick, so just...don't panic, alright?"Of course, I did panic. I actually bleated, when his head finally butted through my entrance - I heard myself, and it was a total 'oh god please help me' noise. The pain was so sudden and intense that my dick deflated to nothing, my balls ran and hid somewhere up behind my lungs, which also mostly stopped functioning, and all I could think was that there was no 'probably' about this, and that 'hurt' was kind of an inadequate word for what I was currently experiencing... Tahi's voice broke through the panic-haze. "Zac," he was hissing, "Zac!"It was the first time he'd used my name."Hey, c'mon, now," he was saying. "You needa relax."Relax? I thought, even my breathing laboured and effortful. Who relaxes when they're literally being stabbed in the guts?He laid a warm palm on my tailbone. "Relax," he urged, "let go back here - you're cramping up on me something fierce."Oh. Right. That. Relax that. Instead of trying to escape the pain, I turned my thoughts toward it. Let go, he said...I focused and tried it, and almost immediately the tentacles of agony that'd been strangling my innards slackened their hold."That's it," he murmured, "that's it, well done," then he nudged himself a little further forward and I gurgled in frustration as everything slammed shut all over again."Relax," he soothed me, again. "C'mon, you know you can do it."I could, and I did, and he inched in some more, and some more, and some more, just talking to me quietly all the while. It seemed like it took a long time before he stilled and started drawing little circles on the skin of my hips with his fingers."You got it all now, you got it all," he told me. "How 'bout that? How's that feel?"It felt...invasive, it felt disorienting, it felt absolutely massive...which confused me, because I'd been up close and very personal with it only a couple of hours before, and hadn't thought it was anything particularly freakish.I was still trying to make sense of this conundrum as he backed up, slow and deliberate. I handled that, but when he switched to boring in on me again everything howled in protest, boiling and churning in a fruitless attempt to expel him.I groaned a very 'I'm feeling sorry for myself' groan."C'mon," he chided, as he bottomed out and started once more on his leisurely withdrawal, "you wanted it, I know you did - and I think you still do."He was right, I realised. I did still want it, with my mind and my self and even my soul if I had such a thing, and my body was just going to have to suck it up and deal. As he came forward again, I gritted my teeth and drove myself back onto him.It didn't hurt. Like, barely at all. I could hardly believe it, but it wasn't a fluke - it was the same as I met his next stroke, only better, and the next was better again. He didn't feel too big now. He felt just right...exactly right. He fitted - we fitted - snugly, perfectly, precisely. I began to have this sense of a party starting up, just getting going, somewhere inside me, as I heard Tahi say;"Yeah you got it sorted now, haven't ya?" sounding almost like he was purring. "Didn't take you long, did it, bub?"We settled into a sort of syncopated rhythm, him holding me captive as he pulled back teasingly slow, then freeing me so I could impale myself on him as he snapped forward, making the stroke fast and sharp. It went on and on and on, and oh jesus it was sublime. I felt almost like I was moving into some sort of altered consciousness, where everything that was real, everything that counted, was taking place in super-concentrated fashion at this conjoined focal point, and any other stuff...out there...meh.I was aware in some removed way, of layers of noise...a morepork, moreporking away on the next ridge, Tahi grunting and swearing in and around his thrusts, myself making random strangled squeaks when he prodded at something in there that set off a little shower of sparks all through my body. I could hear it, all of it, but it was like it was miles away. I knew that the night had gotten cold, but it wasn't affecting me, it was just a disconnected fact floating around. I could also tell I was hard again, but even that seemed irrelevant somehow. All that mattered was this urgent driving push and pull, this ever accelerating tempo, escalating faster and faster toward some unseen finish line...I may not have seen it, but by god I felt it, when he reached that line. He got harder - a lot harder - and thicker, he shoved wildly and desperately and managed to introduce himself to a part of my passage he hadn't previously met, and it all got kinda uncomfortable again, but at the same time it felt so amazing that I couldn't even handle it. Couldn't move, couldn't think, couldn't maintain my footing. I could only formlessly feel...and want.After a few seconds, Tahi's hands released their death-grip on my hips and he sort of drooped forward, his forehead coming to rest between my shoulder-blades. "Jesus," he wheezed. "Fu-u-uck..."His forehead was hot, and slick with sweat against my skin, and his panting breaths were a warm fog spreading down my spine, and I started to become aware that I was a bit cold. I struggled upright as he peeled himself off and out of me, pulling my t-shirt back down, blindly diving into my hoodie, lapping it over my chest and holding it in place with crossed arms, tucking in on myself as the shivering overtook me completely. Fuck, now I was really cold...my teeth were chattering audibly as I stumbled into my jeans, and Tahi noticed."Are you okay?""I'm - hh - fine," I managed to force out.He stepped over, taking my face in a hand, leaning in close to peer at me. "Seriously, e hoa. Was that a bit much for you? Are you alright?""Jussst - c-cold," I juddered.The concern cleared momentarily from his expression, then returned. "Ahh, crap." He lifted - he fucking lifted me - up to sit on the ute's deck and quickly stuffed my feet back into my boots, then he pulled me down again and walked me around the front, pressing my upper body down onto the ute's bonnet."There, get a bit of that," he murmured.Mmmmm...it was nice. Real nice. Like a big hot water bottle. There was even some residual heat still leaking out through the radiator to toast my thighs. Then Tahi sealed himself to me again, draping himself everywhere, warming me from behind."I should've bent you over here instead, shouldn't I?" He ground in closer with his groin, and husked into my ear, "Yeah, and, I would bend you over here, if I thought I had any juice at all left in me. And you'd let me, wouldn't you?"It was another question-that-wasn't-a-question. Yes. Yes, I would. Even though the backs of my legs were sore from being folded over so long, and my ring was raw from those countless passes of his dick, and my innards felt disordered by all the poking and stabbing they'd endured, and my balls were aching from this day of endless arousal, yes, I would totally have let him do it again. And again. And again. I knew without a sliver of doubt that I'd arrived at my calling, I had found my thing, and that certainty warmed me from the inside...He stood up and away when I stopped shuddering, and I heard him light a cigarette. I stayed how I was, still craving the engine's warmth, and he absentmindedly rubbed my back with the heel of his free hand until the cigarette was done. Then he swatted my arse."Alright. Up now, Nipper. Let's get you back home so you can wank yourself dry before lights-out, eh?"I kept my face turned away as I scurried around to the passenger door and clambered in. Whether he was serious, or taking the piss, that felt...uncomfortably prophetic. Seeing as Lucas was basically guaranteed to be out for at least another two hours, 'wank myself dry' was in fact exactly what I was planning to do - get myself off as many times as possible, tonight, while the echoes of what we'd just done still lingered in my nerve endings...but it was definitely weird hearing it laid out in the open like that.I snuck a look at him, briefly meeting his eyes when I climbed back in for a second time after shutting the paddock's gate, to check whether he might be laughing at me. He wasn't. It was just that glowing smile, same as ever. I leaned my head against the glass and tried to seal the memory inside of my eyelids, because I knew that though the feeling of him on me, and in me, would fade in a day or two, I could be dining out for a long, long time on the memory of that bacon sandwich smile. <|endoftext|> I knelt quickly down, and straightaway buried my face in his bush, to orient myself, buy some time, work out what I was meant to be doing here. He had a crotch smell...a quick dip in plain cold water had probably blunted it some, but not erased it. Sweat and work and man, but his skin was clean, cool and soft, delicate almost. Gorgeous. Mouth-watering.I was still kinda hesitant when I first took him in, but that lasted all of a second. I'd forgotten how sensitive your tongue is, how much you can feel, not just taste, with your mouth. So much contrast, so much everything. Mind-boggling. Up, and down, drooling everywhere, tight smooth skin in a long lap under my tongue when I relaxed it broad and flat, giving way to concertinaed folds under the head that I could riffle and burrow into when I tensed it to a point.He liked that, I could tell. I could tell, because I could feel everything, transmitting through, and I could not get enough of it. I soon sensed it coming to an end, though. He hadn't thrust into me initially, had been letting me explore in my own time, figure it out for myself, but he'd started to twitch his hips, to back-and-forth minimally, then less minimally. I just moulded myself to him like a limpet, bracing my hands on his thighs, and let him clasp my skull in his hands, get on with the doing while I revelled in the feeling, and in no time at all he was spurting into my mouth, I was swallowing him down, and it was done. We were done.I came back to earth with a cold hard thump. What now? What was he going to do? Call me a fag? Point and laugh? Tell his mates - my brother - that I sucked dick? Or just walk off and ignore me? I decided to walk off myself before I could find out, but as I was scrambling to my feet he caught my wrist, arrested me, made me look at him."That was sweet...fuckin' A," he breathed, leaning in, "and hey, if you think you might want more, you come and find me later. After dinner, alright?"I nodded blindly and stumbled away, too fogged with arousal shot through with fading stabs of panic - god, that could have gone so wrong - to give him an answer.It was all hell in the house when I got there. I couldn't risk a wank because Lucas was done for the day, and instead of sitting on his arse staring at his phone in the lounge, he was sitting on his arse staring at his phone in the bedroom, and the bathroom was right through the wall, and just...nah...Also I had no spare time, as I was angrily reminded by Mum. "Where the hell have you been, mister?""Went for a walk," I shrugged.She rounded on me. "A walk? And you thought the dogs and the chooks would just feed themselves, did you? Hop to it - it's almost dark!""You could've gotten Lucas to do it," I sulked, taking the dog roll out of the bottom drawer of the fridge."Lucas has been working all day," she snapped at me."Whereas I've just been batting my friggin' eyelashes and looking ornamental?" I enquired, angrily hacking off a couple of chunks.She held the vegetable peeler up underneath my nose. "Don't you talk to me like that, my boy!"I pushed it aside. "Alright, alright! I'm doing it, aren't I? Jesus god, I'm doing it!"Am I doing the other thing, though? I asked myself, out in the cool dusk, hosing out the dogs' bowls. Am I? Have I tried enough risky shit for today, or should I take what chances I can get, when I can get them?I knew what my answer was gonna be before dinner was through. Once his plate was clear, Lucas pushed back his chair and asked Dad for the key to the gun safe."Me 'n' some of those guys, we thought we'd go spotlighting down on the south flat - it's all clear of stock now."Dad handed it over. "Check it with Warren first. Remember, he's your employer. Anything goes wrong, it's on him.""Already did," Lucas assured him, sauntering away.Yes! I thought, something leaping in my chest. Yes! That's you out of the way, for hours and hours and hours. But will Tahi go out with you, or will he stay...for me? Only one way to find out...I cleared the table without being asked, dried the dishes without being reminded, getting back into the good books.Hanging the tea-towel back up, I said, "Mum, can I go up to the shearer's quarters? They have a playstation.""But they've gone out spotlighting," she countered."Nah, not all of them," I assured her.She squinted at me. "What makes you think they're going to want you up there, hanging about like a lost dog?""They said I could," I insisted, "they invited me! Mum! C'mon...they have a playstation!" Doing my best adolescent whining.She shook her head and laughed. "Okay. But don't outstay your welcome, and don't, don't, let them feed you anything stronger than beer. I really mean that, Isaac."I raised my hands in surrender. "Sure, sure, okay. I'll behave. I might just take a shower, before I head up there.""Good idea," her voice wafted after me down the hall, "you pretty much stink, right now."I felt some definite butterflies in my gut when I knocked on the door of the shearer's quarters, but they flew away the moment Tahi opened the door, leaned against the frame, and ran his eyes over me as his face slowly split into a smile. My pulse spiked that he was so obviously pleased to see me. Well, of course he was pleased. Me showing up meant he was gonna get off again.Then I noticed he was still part-way through his dinner...he had a bacon sandwich grasped in one hand. My eyes practically rolled back in my head.Holy shit, I thought, the only way you could possibly make this man any more irresistible would be to give him a bacon sandwich to hold, and here he is. Completely fucking perfect. I'd swallow it all, and then start on the fingers, and then...It seemed like he read my mind, because he slowly brought up his hand, twisted his wrist, held it out in front of my mouth. It looked pretty damn amazing - two fat slabs of white bread, turning translucent toward the centre where the butter had melted on contact with the shaggy ruffled dark pink strips of meat."Open up," he breathed.I did, and he pushed a corner in for me to bite off, winking, saying, "I'll just grab my swannie - be right with you," turning away to leave me drooling on the doorstep.I heard him, muffled, telling someone indoors, "Me an' the nipper might go see if we can catch up to those other tossers, alright? Ka kite, bro." He reappeared, shrugging into his Swanndri, jerking his head at me as he walked past, saying, "C'mon."We got in his ute, and he reached over toward me, the very last bite of sandwich held between thumb and forefinger. I saw the flash of white teeth...another one of those grins, even though I couldn't catch much other detail of his face in the low light. "Saved this for ya - thought that mouth of yours deserved a reward."I laughed and let him feed it to me, enjoying everything about the experience. As we rolled down the gravel driveway, he said, "Well, you're the one who knows your way around. Where can we head that's good and private, where those other guys most definitely aren't?""They went to the south flat," I told him. "So we should go the other way - turn left."As he drove, I tried to think of something, somewhere. Obviously there was a pretty low risk of running into random people out prowling, given we were on the middle of a farm in the middle of nowhere, but still...in some sense, the best way to not be seen was to head into the bush like earlier, except it'd be so dark right now under the canopy that you literally wouldn't be able to see a hand held up in front of your face. Then I had a brainwave, and directed him off the road, through a gate and up a shallow incline."There's a little hollow behind that stand of macrocarpas," I told him, as we lurched across the paddock. There were also a couple of concrete water-tanks and an old broken-down pump inside a crumbling lean-to, so we'd be sheltered on three sides.He nursed the ute up the last bit of slope and over the tiny crest, tucking it in behind the arc of trees, killing the lights, turning off the engine, leaving the key in the ignition.As we got out our respective doors, I heard him say, "This is a nice place."I'd never particularly thought about it before...little hollows are mostly just a pain in the arse when you're trying to move a mob of sheep."C'mere," he told me, and I padded over to stand next to his blurred outline, as he sat on the ute's lowered tailgate, staring toward the next slightly higher ridge, to the northeast. There was a band of cloud lying across the horizon, but above it the sky was clear, and there was a vague glow to the cloud's upper edge. The moon was rising behind, I realised - it'd probably be lighter in half an hour's time than now. It was nice. It was really nice. I was...kinda nervous about this whole thing...I could feel my heartbeat throbbing up in my throat, but all the same I knew I didn't want to be anywhere except here.Tahi reached out a hand and unzipped my hoodie, pushed it back off my shoulders, dropped it to one side on the ute's deck. He didn't say anything, so I didn't either. Instead, he took hold of my waist and manoeuvred me so I was standing in front of him, facing away. I felt his hands settle on my back, stilled for a moment, each side of my spine, warm in contrast to the evening air. Then he started to massage, walking his fingers up and down my backbone, digging in with thumbs under my shoulder-blades, gripping and rolling my trapezius muscles. Very quickly, I had way too much going on, lots of disjointed thoughts ricocheting around...oh my god, he's touching me, aaaaagh so good, he's a pro at this...shit, that hurts right there...oh fuck...touching mee...I leaned into him, melting under his kneading fingers, picturing his own back in my mind, how amazing it was to watch him at work, thinking too about this labour I'd been doing for only three days, that'd made me all inflamed and tender, while he was hefting around wooly carcasses that weighed about the same as a bag of concrete day in, day out, and it was all nothing to him...easy. At least, he made it look easy, he was so competent, so fluid and efficient with his movements. I wondered if the sheep felt his magic the same as I did when they got up close...the assurance hanging about him like an aura, and that's why they went all passive and slack, just like I had.Mostly had. There was one part of me that was a very long way from being passive or slack. He hadn't tried to explore anywhere near there, and I instinctively knew he wouldn't. I didn't mind - I was so keyed up at that point that there was a major risk I'd embarrass myself if he so much as grazed it. Even thinking that thought caused my balls to draw up, my dick to strain like it was trying to burst out of itself. I breathed, slow and steady, focusing on the knots his thumbs were working in my lumbar curve.He spoke, finally. "So, you came back."I nodded, swallowed...it made a kind of squinching sound in the stillness of the evening. "Uh-huh.""Guess that means you decided you did want more?"I just nodded again, feeling that throbbing in my throat quite distinctly now.He leaned forward a little, and I felt his breath against the back of my neck. "And what it is that you're wanting?" he prompted, very softly.I didn't say anything. I couldn't."You gone all shy on me?" he teased, running a fingernail up my spine, all the way to my neck, "You didn't seem so shy a coupla hours ago. Least, not once I got you started. Though you were a bit quiet at the beginning, now that I think of it, eh?"I stayed silent, motionless, as the finger traced down again, all the way, until it dipped slowly, purposefully, below the waistband of my jeans, lingering for a few seconds, before he removed it and said;"Fact is, I'd like to fuck you, but only if you're sure you're good with it. Otherwise, I'd definitely take another session with that mouth of yours, because that was also...a fine, fine thing." Hands on my hips now, he turned me around to face him again, raising my chin until I was looking at him. "So...whaddaya say? What'll it be? You gonna let me fuck you?"I got a huge surge of adrenaline through my body, terror and euphoria both spiking - it was like that moment the year before, when I'd been standing on the platform above the Kawarau Gorge, ankles bound together, attached to a bungee cord - the sudden sense of...shit just got real. I'd been hellishly scared looking down, but I hadn't regretted jumping, not even while I was still falling. I didn't think I'd regret this either, so I told him yes.He treated me to another ones of those smiles. "Okay," he murmured, "okay...now how 'bout you lose those jeans?"My heart hammered even more insistently at the base of my throat as I bent down to undo my boots, and I felt lightheaded when I came upright again to toe them off. He gestured at me, a rolling motion of his hands...continue, continue...I took a big gulping breath and pushed down my jeans. I'd decided to go commando too after my shower, for the secret thrill of it, and now it wasn't secret anymore. I covered myself with my hands.He snorted. "Hey, what's that all about? Lemme look! I think I can prolly handle it..."I didn't know why I didn't want him to see, given that he had to know I was hard, that I'd been that way, painfully so, since he'd forced that first chunk of bacon sandwich past my lips.The moon broke free of the cloud and washed everything with a milky light, and I saw that he was pouting playfully at me. "Bro, c'mon! I mean, I showed you mine..."That made me laugh, and suddenly everything was okay - the obstruction in my throat dissipated, and I took my hands away from my crotch, flung my arms wide, as if to say, 'ta-da!'His eyes ran over me briefly, then back to my face. "See?" he joked. "I didn't faint!"I twirled around on the spot like some fucking ballet dancer, and laughed some more, and some more. I couldn't stop. I was capering about barefooted in the dew, in the middle of a paddock, in the half-dark, wearing only a t-shirt and a hard-on, and I was about to give myself up in pretty much the most intimate way possible to someone I barely knew. It was utterly insane, and I absolutely didn't care...I'd never felt more alive.He slipped down off the ute's tailgate, pulling off his swanndri as he did, and beckoned me over, stood behind me, his body flush with mine and radiating heat. He wrapped me up, forearms across my front, trapping my arms by my sides, and began to flex his hips back and forth against my butt. I got that liquid sensation through my muscles that I'd felt earlier, the same wooziness in my head, and just let myself go to bathe in it.Before long, he broke the spell, his upper arm keeping me clamped while the lower one reached briefly between our bodies, and then his fly was undone again - I could feel the cold teeth of his out-turned zipper making a raspy track across each of my cheeks, and the compelling, urgent heat of his sturdy erection nestled between them, now catching, tugging on my skin as he started up his frotting once more. It was sensational. I let my head loll back against his shoulder as I shifted my hips side-to-side and ground back, seeking more contact."You like that, eh?" he growled gently, just above my ear.I tried to say, 'Uh-huh,' but it got mangled on the way out, and just ended up as 'uhhhhh...' a long breathy moan.He chuckled softly, and squeezed with his arms. "You done this before, bro?""Nuh-uh," I whispered, still moving in time with his slow hypnotic rhythm."You play with yourself at all? Toys, anything like that?"I shook my head vigorously. How could I have? I lived in a house that had one bathroom and zero lockable doors, and I shared a bedroom with my brother. Anything you couldn't do quickly in the shower, or subtly under the sheets once Lucas was snoring - you couldn't do at all."Alright," he breathed, "we'll take it nice and easy, then. Nice and easy. Plenty of time, after all."He released me to fold up his swanndri, laying my hoodie over it, making a sort of pillow on the ute's deck, then he shuffled me around until he had me arranged how he wanted, standing spread-legged and bent forward horizontal from the hips, my t-shirt pushed up around my armpits, my head laid on my folded arms, which were resting on the pile of clothing. I felt incredibly vulnerable, on display like that, knowing he was standing behind me, looking...planning. It was scary, but definitely a good kind of scary. I was still hard as a railway spike.He patted me on an arse-cheek. "Wait there, don't move," walking around to the front of the ute, opening the door to the cabin. He had a pot of something in his hand which he set down by my shoulder when he returned. It was obviously some kind of lube, because a few seconds later, I felt the tips of his fingers fan out on my cheeks, spreading me, as his thumbs gently massaged something around my hole. It was sensation overload...I bit my lip, closed my eyes, and panted.Then he slowly, smoothly, pushed one in, and I almost came on the spot. He paused for a bit, then withdrew, just as slow, until he'd exited me completely. Then he did it again. And again. And again. Although the physical feeling of having something foreign wedged inside me was...mostly just bizarre, I was madly in love with the idea of it. He's inside me, I kept telling myself, he's inside me. Actually inside me, ohhh god...He leaned all the way forward over me, thumb firmly plugged in, to whisper in my ear, "Shit, that feels good. I am so looking forward to this. You taking this okay?"I nodded, adding some vague noise of assent, and he peeled himself off me, saying, "Alright, let's move it up a notch."It was more of a step-change than a notch when he switched from the thumb to two fingers - they didn't just glide, he had to apply genuine pressure to break through the ring, and I felt a twinge that made my breath catch, a definite dull throb in its wake. But so far from putting me off, it sent the anticipation and euphoria I was already feeling soaring into some out-of-control spiral of craving. I was tripping plenty already, but I just. wanted. more.Slowly, slowly, he drew both fingers out again, and reached forward to fumble with the pot he'd put down beside me. I opened my eyes and saw that it was a tub of the grease he used for cleaning and lubricating his combs and blades. For some reason, the idea struck me as utterly hilarious. I tried not to laugh as he began working more of the stuff in and around my hole, but like always, holding it in made things worse, and I ended up consumed with giggling."Wassup?" Tahi asked me, as I tailed off. "I never heard of anybody being ticklish back here."That got me going all over again, and he leant forward onto me, like he had before, to speak in my ear, but closer this time, stilling my shudders with his weight as I felt his dick lodge itself along the valley of my crack, thrumming with presence, with promise."You're freaking out a little bit, aren't you?" he breathed. "Keep it together here, e tama. It's the first time, so yeah...it probably is gonna hurt some at the beginning, but it'll sort itself out real quick, so just...don't panic, alright?"Of course, I did panic. I actually bleated, when his head finally butted through my entrance - I heard myself, and it was a total 'oh god please help me' noise. The pain was so sudden and intense that my dick deflated to nothing, my balls ran and hid somewhere up behind my lungs, which also mostly stopped functioning, and all I could think was that there was no 'probably' about this, and that 'hurt' was kind of an inadequate word for what I was currently experiencing...
 Tahi's voice broke through the panic-haze. "Zac," he was hissing, "Zac!"It was the first time he'd used my name."Hey, c'mon, now," he was saying. "You needa relax."Relax? I thought, even my breathing laboured and effortful. Who relaxes when they're literally being stabbed in the guts?He laid a warm palm on my tailbone. "Relax," he urged, "let go back here - you're cramping up on me something fierce."Oh. Right. That. Relax that. Instead of trying to escape the pain, I turned my thoughts toward it. Let go, he said...I focused and tried it, and almost immediately the tentacles of agony that'd been strangling my innards slackened their hold."That's it," he murmured, "that's it, well done," then he nudged himself a little further forward and I gurgled in frustration as everything slammed shut all over again."Relax," he soothed me, again. "C'mon, you know you can do it."I could, and I did, and he inched in some more, and some more, and some more, just talking to me quietly all the while. It seemed like it took a long time before he stilled and started drawing little circles on the skin of my hips with his fingers."You got it all now, you got it all," he told me. "How 'bout that? How's that feel?"It felt...invasive, it felt disorienting, it felt absolutely massive...which confused me, because I'd been up close and very personal with it only a couple of hours before, and hadn't thought it was anything particularly freakish.I was still trying to make sense of this conundrum as he backed up, slow and deliberate. I handled that, but when he switched to boring in on me again everything howled in protest, boiling and churning in a fruitless attempt to expel him.I groaned a very 'I'm feeling sorry for myself' groan."C'mon," he chided, as he bottomed out and started once more on his leisurely withdrawal, "you wanted it, I know you did - and I think you still do."He was right, I realised. I did still want it, with my mind and my self and even my soul if I had such a thing, and my body was just going to have to suck it up and deal. As he came forward again, I gritted my teeth and drove myself back onto him.It didn't hurt. Like, barely at all. I could hardly believe it, but it wasn't a fluke - it was the same as I met his next stroke, only better, and the next was better again. He didn't feel too big now. He felt just right...exactly right. He fitted - we fitted - snugly, perfectly, precisely. I began to have this sense of a party starting up, just getting going, somewhere inside me, as I heard Tahi say;"Yeah you got it sorted now, haven't ya?" sounding almost like he was purring. "Didn't take you long, did it, bub?"We settled into a sort of syncopated rhythm, him holding me captive as he pulled back teasingly slow, then freeing me so I could impale myself on him as he snapped forward, making the stroke fast and sharp. It went on and on and on, and oh jesus it was sublime. I felt almost like I was moving into some sort of altered consciousness, where everything that was real, everything that counted, was taking place in super-concentrated fashion at this conjoined focal point, and any other stuff...out there...meh.I was aware in some removed way, of layers of noise...a morepork, moreporking away on the next ridge, Tahi grunting and swearing in and around his thrusts, myself making random strangled squeaks when he prodded at something in there that set off a little shower of sparks all through my body. I could hear it, all of it, but it was like it was miles away. I knew that the night had gotten cold, but it wasn't affecting me, it was just a disconnected fact floating around. I could also tell I was hard again, but even that seemed irrelevant somehow. All that mattered was this urgent driving push and pull, this ever accelerating tempo, escalating faster and faster toward some unseen finish line...I may not have seen it, but by god I felt it, when he reached that line. He got harder - a lot harder - and thicker, he shoved wildly and desperately and managed to introduce himself to a part of my passage he hadn't previously met, and it all got kinda uncomfortable again, but at the same time it felt so amazing that I couldn't even handle it. Couldn't move, couldn't think, couldn't maintain my footing. I could only formlessly feel...and want.After a few seconds, Tahi's hands released their death-grip on my hips and he sort of drooped forward, his forehead coming to rest between my shoulder-blades. "Jesus," he wheezed. "Fu-u-uck..."His forehead was hot, and slick with sweat against my skin, and his panting breaths were a warm fog spreading down my spine, and I started to become aware that I was a bit cold. I struggled upright as he peeled himself off and out of me, pulling my t-shirt back down, blindly diving into my hoodie, lapping it over my chest and holding it in place with crossed arms, tucking in on myself as the shivering overtook me completely. Fuck, now I was really cold...my teeth were chattering audibly as I stumbled into my jeans, and Tahi noticed."Are you okay?""I'm - hh - fine," I managed to force out.He stepped over, taking my face in a hand, leaning in close to peer at me. "Seriously, e hoa. Was that a bit much for you? Are you alright?""Jussst - c-cold," I juddered.The concern cleared momentarily from his expression, then returned. "Ahh, crap." He lifted - he fucking lifted me - up to sit on the ute's deck and quickly stuffed my feet back into my boots, then he pulled me down again and walked me around the front, pressing my upper body down onto the ute's bonnet."There, get a bit of that," he murmured.Mmmmm...it was nice. Real nice. Like a big hot water bottle. There was even some residual heat still leaking out through the radiator to toast my thighs. Then Tahi sealed himself to me again, draping himself everywhere, warming me from behind."I should've bent you over here instead, shouldn't I?" He ground in closer with his groin, and husked into my ear, "Yeah, and, I would bend you over here, if I thought I had any juice at all left in me. And you'd let me, wouldn't you?"It was another question-that-wasn't-a-question. Yes. Yes, I would. Even though the backs of my legs were sore from being folded over so long, and my ring was raw from those countless passes of his dick, and my innards felt disordered by all the poking and stabbing they'd endured, and my balls were aching from this day of endless arousal, yes, I would totally have let him do it again. And again. And again. I knew without a sliver of doubt that I'd arrived at my calling, I had found my thing, and that certainty warmed me from the inside...He stood up and away when I stopped shuddering, and I heard him light a cigarette. I stayed how I was, still craving the engine's warmth, and he absentmindedly rubbed my back with the heel of his free hand until the cigarette was done. Then he swatted my arse."Alright. Up now, Nipper. Let's get you back home so you can wank yourself dry before lights-out, eh?"I kept my face turned away as I scurried around to the passenger door and clambered in. Whether he was serious, or taking the piss, that felt...uncomfortably prophetic. Seeing as Lucas was basically guaranteed to be out for at least another two hours, 'wank myself dry' was in fact exactly what I was planning to do - get myself off as many times as possible, tonight, while the echoes of what we'd just done still lingered in my nerve endings...but it was definitely weird hearing it laid out in the open like that.I snuck a look at him, briefly meeting his eyes when I climbed back in for a second time after shutting the paddock's gate, to check whether he might be laughing at me. He wasn't. It was just that glowing smile, same as ever. I leaned my head against the glass and tried to seal the memory inside of my eyelids, because I knew that though the feeling of him on me, and in me, would fade in a day or two, I could be dining out for a long, long time on the memory of that bacon sandwich smile.
