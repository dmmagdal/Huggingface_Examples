### Notes:
 - If you can't get an example to run on docker, chances are I ran it on my Dell desktop bare metal (Intel i7-10700 CPU @ 2.90GHz, RAM 16GB, GPU Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER 8GB VRAM). There is a slight bit of resource overhead when running an example on Docker in Windows 10 vs running the program bare metal on the OS.
